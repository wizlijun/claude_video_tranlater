If you think brains we only

00:00:03,768 --> 00:00:06,960
you think tend to with our

3
00:00:06,300 --> 00:00:09,904
see replacement AI as a of

4
00:00:09,679 --> 00:00:13,584
use our AI thinking to process

5
00:00:12,184 --> 00:00:16,174
think We for And us that's

6
00:00:15,525 --> 00:00:19,411
instead obviously think a risk like

7
00:00:19,264 --> 00:00:21,622
And that if you you do

8
00:00:21,119 --> 00:00:23,833
thinking that for yourself You stop

00:00:23,159 --> 00:00:25,199
You let work AI do the

not that just our a thoughts

your to book the How show

57
00:02:24,704 --> 00:02:27,221
to So Take your Smart resonated

58
00:02:26,816 --> 00:02:29,439
Notes with so it's many world

59
00:02:28,682 --> 00:02:31,516
people You've around sold the over

60
00:02:31,120 --> 00:02:33,954
You've 100 000 translated copies into

61
00:02:33,599 --> 00:02:36,799
Did eight you ever languages expect

62
00:02:36,319 --> 00:02:39,999
notes your book would on taking

63
00:02:39,231 --> 00:02:42,442
become Um so I widespread had

64
00:02:42,442 --> 00:02:46,149
two thoughts I sell one a

65
00:02:45,698 --> 00:02:49,549
is few hopefully more than uh

66
00:02:48,959 --> 00:02:52,127
I 10 have copies I had

67
00:02:52,100 --> 00:02:55,296
and mainly mind my because own

68
00:02:55,296 --> 00:02:59,735
students I couldn't in helpful find

69
00:02:59,440 --> 00:03:03,653
book a on really writing that

70
00:03:02,960 --> 00:03:07,705
and mirrors notetaking the developed way

71
00:03:07,705 --> 00:03:11,723
I thought a thesis we So

72
00:03:11,723 --> 00:03:14,231
there a need to was write

73
00:03:13,970 --> 00:03:16,208
just that feel because comfortable I

74
00:03:16,208 --> 00:03:19,553
didn't with available the ones that

75
00:03:19,163 --> 00:03:22,923
I were did it not resonated

76
00:03:21,125 --> 00:03:24,396
expect at so all much that

77
00:03:24,305 --> 00:03:33,040
with of people outside academia um I'm very And

78
00:03:30,853 --> 00:03:37,577
pleased how ideas people and developed

79
00:03:36,008 --> 00:03:40,528
took around their it own So

80
00:03:39,845 --> 00:03:44,016
systems I instruction see it less

81
00:03:44,016 --> 00:03:46,976
as and an more sparked as

82
00:03:46,976 --> 00:03:52,762
something a discussion that I'm happening really

83
00:03:52,762 --> 00:03:55,399
glad um And so Yeah for

84
00:03:55,399 --> 00:03:57,559
those who book haven't can read

85
00:03:57,459 --> 00:04:00,059
you your immediate give us kind

86
00:03:59,447 --> 00:04:01,940
idea about of an what what

87
00:04:01,483 --> 00:04:04,260
it's kind about of and benefits

88
00:04:03,519 --> 00:04:05,706
adopters could that expect say to

89
00:04:05,420 --> 00:04:07,415
new to your learn from Yeah

90
00:04:07,013 --> 00:04:09,695
method I mean there describe are

91
00:04:09,695 --> 00:04:12,525
multiple ways what to about the

92
00:04:12,525 --> 00:04:16,230
tetra Um one cousin way is

93
00:04:16,011 --> 00:04:18,585
is it's all um to a

94
00:04:18,585 --> 00:04:24,608
system write notes that connect in

95
00:04:23,919 --> 00:04:27,572
build a something way that you

96
00:04:27,446 --> 00:04:29,600
out can of you them have

97
00:04:29,561 --> 00:04:32,653
and as you where called brain

98
00:04:32,160 --> 00:04:34,598
it or the an second external

99
00:04:34,598 --> 00:04:37,030
brain dialogue you're with Another in

100
00:04:37,030 --> 00:04:39,916
a it way to and describe

101
00:04:38,858 --> 00:04:42,203
that's is how um I did

102
00:04:41,751 --> 00:04:44,879
the it author in the book

103
00:04:44,499 --> 00:04:49,677
and Nicholas social Luman scientist I

104
00:04:49,677 --> 00:04:53,514
studied he's a system the most

105
00:04:52,645 --> 00:04:56,613
theory um thinker incredibly um he

106
00:04:56,399 --> 00:04:59,460
productive was 60 books um and

107
00:04:58,959 --> 00:05:02,185
writing less than almost 30 years

108
00:05:01,520 --> 00:05:07,395
of hundreds articles and um whenever

109
00:05:07,395 --> 00:05:11,235
he was was asked earth he

110
00:05:10,920 --> 00:05:13,035
um was how able to on

111
00:05:12,870 --> 00:05:14,959
be um that he productive referred

112
00:05:14,959 --> 00:05:17,465
to his obviously subtle cousin uh

113
00:05:17,465 --> 00:05:19,628
as So someone lot who with

114
00:05:19,330 --> 00:05:22,245
struggled writing a I this was

115
00:05:21,739 --> 00:05:24,862
system intrigued is all about uh

116
00:05:24,862 --> 00:05:27,139
what and there research project is

117
00:05:27,139 --> 00:05:30,056
a still it's going such a

118
00:05:29,416 --> 00:05:33,224
on because vast amount needs of

119
00:05:32,604 --> 00:05:36,920
to notes be digitalized that put

120
00:05:36,914 --> 00:05:40,880
and online um but there Um

121
00:05:40,143 --> 00:05:43,653
was very at little that available

122
00:05:42,398 --> 00:05:46,194
time Um uh but who there

123
00:05:45,140 --> 00:05:49,469
work with are others similar so

124
00:05:49,060 --> 00:05:53,429
methods I tried and um to

125
00:05:52,626 --> 00:05:57,010
how that understand really worked in

126
00:05:56,400 --> 00:06:02,702
manner a practical that was fascinating and to

127
00:06:02,702 --> 00:06:04,822
me and wanted um to so

128
00:06:04,580 --> 00:06:06,680
write I about wasn't that because

129
00:06:06,432 --> 00:06:10,188
anything there described available that the

130
00:06:09,648 --> 00:06:13,823
really method the and same because

131
00:06:12,924 --> 00:06:17,332
time I taught at um a

132
00:06:16,490 --> 00:06:22,540
learning lot about theories how I

133
00:06:21,399 --> 00:06:26,862
much the realized settle casten research

134
00:06:25,959 --> 00:06:31,617
put modern into practice probably without

135
00:06:30,208 --> 00:06:35,128
being lumen aware and thirdly of

136
00:06:35,128 --> 00:06:38,346
that it resonates Um but with

137
00:06:38,080 --> 00:06:41,813
line um a of new that

138
00:06:40,358 --> 00:06:46,211
research often goes under the label

139
00:06:45,120 --> 00:06:50,144
thinking of external realization So how

140
00:06:50,098 --> 00:06:54,015
the much of our environment contributes to

141
00:06:54,015 --> 00:06:59,258
our thinking processes we and how

142
00:06:59,258 --> 00:07:04,479
much can to do improve our

143
00:07:04,479 --> 00:07:07,672
thinking little by bit thinking more

144
00:07:07,672 --> 00:07:11,561
systematically a we design about our

145
00:07:10,900 --> 00:07:14,988
how think environment Um in so

146
00:07:14,323 --> 00:07:17,649
which in we a a way

147
00:07:17,173 --> 00:07:22,585
thinking it's all environment about design

148
00:07:21,199 --> 00:07:25,626
that might sound And complicated end

149
00:07:24,282 --> 00:07:27,402
but in the writing it's on

150
00:07:27,402 --> 00:07:33,599
a just daily or regular small

151
00:07:31,326 --> 00:07:38,123
basis and pieces add them to

152
00:07:37,039 --> 00:07:41,319
pool of the ideas existing you

153
00:07:41,319 --> 00:07:45,599
have So your thoughts you extend

154
00:07:44,208 --> 00:07:49,545
instead of them just collecting And

155
00:07:48,800 --> 00:07:55,075
nudges that develop you more complex

156
00:07:53,898 --> 00:07:57,839
to thoughts having the because thoughts

157
00:07:57,839 --> 00:08:01,190
externalized you to allows build impossible up

158
00:08:01,190 --> 00:08:05,648
complexity in which our is tiny

159
00:08:05,120 --> 00:08:09,360
also brain constantly And confronts it

160
00:08:09,360 --> 00:08:13,542
things you you with have And

161
00:08:13,040 --> 00:08:17,431
long that forgotten is like um

162
00:08:16,968 --> 00:08:21,680
a critical builtin element to writing

163
00:08:20,986 --> 00:08:24,880
your Um daily where of you're

164
00:08:23,713 --> 00:08:27,271
things being that might reminded be

165
00:08:27,271 --> 00:08:30,326
um to contradictory your great idea

166
00:08:30,240 --> 00:08:32,634
morning you had in and the

167
00:08:32,208 --> 00:08:35,112
instead out um of just you

168
00:08:34,832 --> 00:08:38,408
putting contrast it that you with

169
00:08:37,630 --> 00:08:42,610
have something already written these down

170
00:08:41,888 --> 00:08:44,912
are the And moments something usually

171
00:08:44,661 --> 00:08:47,510
interesting where happens have contradicting where

172
00:08:47,510 --> 00:08:51,032
you figure ideas out and well

173
00:08:50,336 --> 00:08:52,980
have to um or is can

174
00:08:52,588 --> 00:08:56,061
one I of um them combine

175
00:08:54,922 --> 00:08:58,371
wrong them Um in all in

176
00:08:58,000 --> 00:09:00,996
these a way things you have

177
00:09:00,996 --> 00:09:04,224
a only system happen in place

178
00:09:03,320 --> 00:09:07,049
when have where your you thoughts

179
00:09:05,839 --> 00:09:10,052
externalized in some And way usually

180
00:09:09,279 --> 00:09:12,228
with books we do that and

181
00:09:12,160 --> 00:09:15,177
external articles to all our that

182
00:09:14,877 --> 00:09:17,594
brain is do But we what

183
00:09:16,996 --> 00:09:19,679
usually we just then do it's

184
00:09:19,148 --> 00:09:21,838
in like our brain brain So

185
00:09:21,839 --> 00:09:24,639
and environment the external and that

186
00:09:24,639 --> 00:09:29,232
seat the custom personal expands thinking

187
00:09:27,440 --> 00:09:31,016
to be able to space think

188
00:09:31,016 --> 00:09:33,912
within think that's that and why

189
00:09:33,400 --> 00:09:35,941
I Lumman only be was so

190
00:09:35,635 --> 00:09:38,529
able proficient to not also in

191
00:09:38,275 --> 00:09:41,117
be his writing able to but

192
00:09:41,020 --> 00:09:46,850
develop complex incredibly thoughts and highly

193
00:09:46,007 --> 00:09:50,601
theories consistent that um are within

194
00:09:49,920 --> 00:09:54,292
uh its something itself that wouldn't

195
00:09:53,440 --> 00:09:57,131
that be without possible I a

196
00:09:56,708 --> 00:09:59,955
think system Right So like there's

197
00:09:59,942 --> 00:10:02,188
that this other sure thing you're

198
00:10:01,990 --> 00:10:04,603
I'm you're commonplace aware of book

199
00:10:04,368 --> 00:10:06,256
called it's it's the in been

200
00:10:06,140 --> 00:10:08,440
history famous for Benjamin for many

201
00:10:08,440 --> 00:10:11,625
writers Franklin included is that they

202
00:10:11,360 --> 00:10:14,727
commonplace they created book a where different

203
00:10:14,381 --> 00:10:16,843
they references would note quotes they

204
00:10:16,843 --> 00:10:18,619
would ideas that kind the of

205
00:10:18,544 --> 00:10:19,951
rest keep of with their them

206
00:10:19,951 --> 00:10:21,616
for lives always and an that

207
00:10:21,479 --> 00:10:23,279
important was writing part process of

208
00:10:23,279 --> 00:10:25,600
their Would zodoccasted you say that

209
00:10:25,319 --> 00:10:27,076
method the more is complex kind

210
00:10:27,076 --> 00:10:28,930
of version like a instead of

211
00:10:28,930 --> 00:10:31,279
that of where just writing also

212
00:10:30,751 --> 00:10:35,920
ideas connecting you're related I thoughts

213
00:10:35,399 --> 00:10:40,639
think certainly um it's fits of

214
00:10:39,920 --> 00:10:43,920
into trying the same to category

215
00:10:43,039 --> 00:10:47,120
use external accompany means you and

216
00:10:47,039 --> 00:10:50,320
to um not something just write

217
00:10:49,279 --> 00:10:51,679
down put it back out and

218
00:10:51,200 --> 00:10:54,720
to then the go But blank

219
00:10:53,178 --> 00:10:56,406
the settle page cousin geared is

220
00:10:56,406 --> 00:11:00,763
certainly towards more ideas continuous and

221
00:11:00,763 --> 00:11:04,558
maybe development less of a of

222
00:11:04,434 --> 00:11:09,680
reminder and um um I mean

223
00:11:09,680 --> 00:11:13,600
it's grounded in seeing academia but

224
00:11:13,200 --> 00:11:17,520
how academia much it I resonated

225
00:11:15,911 --> 00:11:19,762
think it outside can of be

226
00:11:19,680 --> 00:11:22,072
maybe seen as a little um

227
00:11:22,079 --> 00:11:24,799
version bit more sophisticated of the

228
00:11:24,799 --> 00:11:27,480
commonplace tell me um book you

229
00:11:27,480 --> 00:11:29,921
know But better you uh I

230
00:11:29,511 --> 00:11:33,928
distinction think the between systems these

231
00:11:33,928 --> 00:11:38,079
two No I I would certainly nuanced

232
00:11:38,025 --> 00:11:39,757
say complex it's a version more

233
00:11:39,760 --> 00:11:43,119
book of and a yet commonplace

234
00:11:41,464 --> 00:11:44,666
it's also more maintain difficult and

235
00:11:44,666 --> 00:11:47,759
that's to systems where like certain

236
00:11:47,039 --> 00:11:49,359
Obsidian Rome and have other kind

237
00:11:49,359 --> 00:11:51,456
of like come the out past

238
00:11:50,958 --> 00:11:53,141
in few many of years easy

239
00:11:53,141 --> 00:11:56,320
to to uh try create to make these it

240
00:11:56,320 --> 00:11:59,809
between relationships different ideas kind in

241
00:11:59,497 --> 00:12:02,848
of doing automatically so I think

242
00:12:02,188 --> 00:12:04,878
but in they the also process

243
00:12:04,000 --> 00:12:07,968
eliminate intentional your own connection ideas

244
00:12:07,968 --> 00:12:10,550
that between perhaps these is some

245
00:12:10,144 --> 00:12:12,434
kind of of the removes critical

246
00:12:12,320 --> 00:12:15,032
making thinking these behind connections because

247
00:12:14,914 --> 00:12:16,790
yourselves I think uh there's what

248
00:12:16,790 --> 00:12:18,354
you this aspect argues of you

249
00:12:18,240 --> 00:12:19,897
writing say in is the not

250
00:12:19,527 --> 00:12:21,554
book just but a the record

251
00:12:20,990 --> 00:12:23,389
act of of thought thinking you

252
00:12:23,131 --> 00:12:25,745
itself argue and that so this

253
00:12:25,279 --> 00:12:27,512
you method to to think is

254
00:12:27,512 --> 00:12:29,747
a about way for these it's

255
00:12:29,747 --> 00:12:32,167
it's things commonly and notated obviously

256
00:12:32,089 --> 00:12:34,239
that thinking whether about you're something

257
00:12:34,130 --> 00:12:36,950
listening book whether to an you're

258
00:12:36,092 --> 00:12:39,170
audio something you're reading is that

259
00:12:39,120 --> 00:12:40,976
remember we we 95 often of

260
00:12:40,976 --> 00:12:42,736
what don't we read but it's

261
00:12:42,368 --> 00:12:44,443
in those a book moments across

262
00:12:44,370 --> 00:12:45,594
when an you idea you come

263
00:12:45,466 --> 00:12:47,270
pause about and that you thought

264
00:12:46,831 --> 00:12:49,185
think you from think a different

265
00:12:48,272 --> 00:12:50,184
about it angle how does you

266
00:12:50,159 --> 00:12:52,261
this think apply about to expand

267
00:12:51,919 --> 00:12:53,374
my on life that you idea

268
00:12:53,239 --> 00:12:54,858
you those of things are the

269
00:12:54,808 --> 00:12:56,312
that types we tend so to

270
00:12:56,026 --> 00:12:57,786
when remember you're and taking that

271
00:12:57,786 --> 00:12:59,865
instinctual that that part kind where

272
00:12:59,440 --> 00:13:01,428
stopping you're and you're something thinking

273
00:13:01,428 --> 00:13:03,332
about and you're system adding then

274
00:13:03,235 --> 00:13:04,664
it you to can a look

275
00:13:04,240 --> 00:13:05,996
expand at on that that and

276
00:13:05,897 --> 00:13:07,968
further that certainly And so I

277
00:13:07,968 --> 00:13:11,780
think writing plays and an active

278
00:13:10,592 --> 00:13:14,164
note taking part of so thinking

279
00:13:13,060 --> 00:13:15,753
I think Um everything and but

280
00:13:15,753 --> 00:13:18,060
um has going its off place

281
00:13:17,325 --> 00:13:19,200
of going Um on uh do

282
00:13:18,897 --> 00:13:20,595
a you tangent have any on

283
00:13:20,160 --> 00:13:22,460
additional top of thoughts that an

284
00:13:22,143 --> 00:13:25,960
Yeah important I think you point

285
00:13:24,723 --> 00:13:28,060
strike on and the um let

286
00:13:27,472 --> 00:13:30,930
role me of comment technology Rome

287
00:13:30,930 --> 00:13:34,781
research like etc obsidian Um I

288
00:13:34,320 --> 00:13:38,548
the think risk there that you

289
00:13:37,863 --> 00:13:41,783
is do just exactly said Um

290
00:13:41,720 --> 00:13:47,025
what automate you connection the building

291
00:13:46,191 --> 00:13:50,543
and therefore of important just step

292
00:13:50,111 --> 00:13:53,623
skip of the thinking connections about

293
00:13:53,623 --> 00:13:57,693
what intellectually make most sense or

294
00:13:57,693 --> 00:14:01,145
by think reasoning this kind But

295
00:14:00,496 --> 00:14:04,855
of technology I have doesn't um

296
00:14:04,799 --> 00:14:08,545
to be used in that way technology I

297
00:14:08,545 --> 00:14:13,511
think that um can complement um

298
00:14:13,511 --> 00:14:18,257
our thinking very well aware if

299
00:14:17,810 --> 00:14:19,990
of we the risk are you

300
00:14:19,839 --> 00:14:22,339
we mentioned try to um use

301
00:14:22,171 --> 00:14:24,839
that it skips in a way

302
00:14:24,240 --> 00:14:27,280
the that thinking that it part

303
00:14:26,720 --> 00:14:30,320
you I use think Obsidian when

304
00:14:30,168 --> 00:14:33,616
or lock Rome and the research

305
00:14:32,588 --> 00:14:36,368
other or tools have the out

306
00:14:35,884 --> 00:14:40,798
birectional there that linking um feature

307
00:14:40,800 --> 00:14:47,323
you get quickly overwhelmed when with

308
00:14:46,853 --> 00:14:50,463
you links automate go that by

309
00:14:50,265 --> 00:14:54,223
process association or like just um

310
00:14:53,680 --> 00:14:56,479
appears oh in this these word

311
00:14:56,480 --> 00:14:58,912
all notes and So I I

312
00:14:58,409 --> 00:15:00,775
have link uh them beautiful a

313
00:15:00,775 --> 00:15:04,367
lot of graphs links with that

314
00:15:04,367 --> 00:15:08,204
can work as a warning this

315
00:15:08,204 --> 00:15:12,369
overwhelming signal interconnectedness um Um if

316
00:15:12,369 --> 00:15:16,185
you encounter you're that once I

317
00:15:16,185 --> 00:15:20,652
think thrown uh the inside back

318
00:15:19,663 --> 00:15:23,239
that any to links deliberate should

319
00:15:23,239 --> 00:15:31,431
be and ideally commented on Um

320
00:15:31,431 --> 00:15:34,687
so points one of I the

321
00:15:34,379 --> 00:15:36,315
keep main uh

322
00:15:35,092 --> 00:15:40,084
stressing method when I is teach

323
00:15:38,859 --> 00:15:43,937
try to the embed notes links

324
00:15:42,516 --> 00:15:47,010
in full to sentences other the

325
00:15:46,806 --> 00:15:49,662
Try relation to between explain two

326
00:15:49,662 --> 00:15:52,313
notes that in your a way

327
00:15:52,198 --> 00:15:56,827
future understand self that can Um

328
00:15:56,115 --> 00:16:00,432
still don't have try bullet to

329
00:16:00,158 --> 00:16:02,711
points just um with um They

330
00:16:02,711 --> 00:16:06,142
have links their place main links

331
00:16:05,068 --> 00:16:08,719
as well but should the yourself

332
00:16:07,357 --> 00:16:12,063
be explained And usually to where

333
00:16:11,359 --> 00:16:15,759
this you is start the moment

334
00:16:14,559 --> 00:16:19,173
thinking intuitively u because often um

335
00:16:18,720 --> 00:16:22,048
between the two relation pieces obvious

336
00:16:21,080 --> 00:16:23,800
of information um you is feel

337
00:16:23,440 --> 00:16:26,595
belongs yeah of together course but

338
00:16:26,136 --> 00:16:29,200
this when make you try it

339
00:16:28,488 --> 00:16:33,066
to you explicit start to usually

340
00:16:31,856 --> 00:16:35,145
struggle the and good that kind

341
00:16:34,592 --> 00:16:37,039
is of first struggle of all

342
00:16:37,039 --> 00:16:39,270
you Um might it's be good

343
00:16:38,799 --> 00:16:41,680
right to and be then because

344
00:16:40,620 --> 00:16:43,360
able to in explain the end

345
00:16:43,321 --> 00:16:46,720
it your knowledge much worth isn't

346
00:16:45,705 --> 00:16:48,862
if you're communicate not able it

347
00:16:48,546 --> 00:16:50,534
to um someone if you else

348
00:16:50,467 --> 00:16:53,362
can't how two things tell each belong

349
00:16:53,362 --> 00:16:58,689
to But other most often you

350
00:16:58,689 --> 00:17:01,992
realize you haven't really that thought

351
00:17:01,600 --> 00:17:03,636
how through two pieces um of

352
00:17:03,360 --> 00:17:07,244
together information belong and information that

353
00:17:07,244 --> 00:17:12,400
you need to more make plausible

354
00:17:10,759 --> 00:17:15,839
the connection So I think um

355
00:17:15,385 --> 00:17:19,117
this can linking be done which

356
00:17:18,479 --> 00:17:22,028
mostly uh if automatic you do

357
00:17:22,028 --> 00:17:25,895
it manually okay um where it's

358
00:17:25,663 --> 00:17:31,386
you interesting feel can here zoom

359
00:17:29,919 --> 00:17:34,280
the most interesting in parts you're

360
00:17:34,007 --> 00:17:35,800
of doing of So what I

361
00:17:35,760 --> 00:17:40,391
not think the linking is support a or

362
00:17:40,391 --> 00:17:44,242
help I think most important it's

363
00:17:44,242 --> 00:17:47,692
often part the of the and

364
00:17:47,206 --> 00:17:50,960
whole the process most interesting right

365
00:17:50,960 --> 00:17:54,320
and I I would in describing a

366
00:17:54,320 --> 00:17:56,933
easier that way of I say

367
00:17:56,376 --> 00:17:59,012
think if if you we are

368
00:17:58,789 --> 00:18:01,784
look a at surgeon perhaps and

369
00:18:01,183 --> 00:18:04,139
on the then side to you're

370
00:18:02,960 --> 00:18:05,360
paint um you or also you

371
00:18:05,321 --> 00:18:08,240
like you're completely in some other

372
00:18:07,599 --> 00:18:11,422
unrelated often field the the people

373
00:18:10,399 --> 00:18:13,012
and it's who multitude end up

374
00:18:13,012 --> 00:18:15,715
in of a fields and they're

375
00:18:14,748 --> 00:18:17,350
that have able interests to take

376
00:18:17,350 --> 00:18:20,016
those overlap ideas them with this

377
00:18:19,530 --> 00:18:22,435
and other profession other and that's

378
00:18:22,080 --> 00:18:24,397
have often innovations where and we

379
00:18:24,360 --> 00:18:26,352
we kind have of ideas further

380
00:18:26,184 --> 00:18:29,120
that society you have along overlapping

381
00:18:28,304 --> 00:18:31,600
because uh different knowledge industries in

382
00:18:31,600 --> 00:18:33,552
these and so this I idea

383
00:18:33,269 --> 00:18:35,992
think of linking kind of notes

384
00:18:35,520 --> 00:18:38,920
like it's a you're similar way

385
00:18:38,499 --> 00:18:42,536
creating of you're this between this

386
00:18:42,192 --> 00:18:46,143
notes this and link thoughts otherwise

387
00:18:45,272 --> 00:18:49,311
that perhaps could forcing be unrelated

388
00:18:48,240 --> 00:18:51,323
yourself It's to specific think idea

389
00:18:51,040 --> 00:18:53,280
about in a a different a

390
00:18:53,280 --> 00:18:54,945
of just way looking instead at

391
00:18:54,945 --> 00:18:56,277
it in way which a in

392
00:18:56,262 --> 00:18:58,506
is a so linear often especially

393
00:18:57,571 --> 00:18:59,731
what we do when bullet we're

394
00:18:59,377 --> 00:19:01,847
points just creating when if highlights

395
00:19:01,013 --> 00:19:02,986
if we have on a we're

396
00:19:02,437 --> 00:19:04,105
book you putting know we're it

397
00:19:03,919 --> 00:19:05,555
category into a and specific then

398
00:19:05,555 --> 00:19:06,782
we it's put a category you

399
00:19:06,782 --> 00:19:08,647
know on if productivity of these

400
00:19:08,647 --> 00:19:10,520
notes all all might this one

401
00:19:10,043 --> 00:19:11,439
just just one be category in

402
00:19:11,440 --> 00:19:16,160
inevitably but there's related ideas I philosophical

403
00:19:14,656 --> 00:19:17,856
industry ideas think that you about

404
00:19:17,344 --> 00:19:19,752
could and allows that could you

405
00:19:19,552 --> 00:19:21,264
be to what have thinking kind

406
00:19:21,264 --> 00:19:23,280
of and to new write creative

407
00:19:23,102 --> 00:19:25,353
and a and different think from

408
00:19:25,198 --> 00:19:27,612
perspective people would than most Yeah

409
00:19:27,595 --> 00:19:29,863
other I think to the art

410
00:19:29,863 --> 00:19:36,106
is um find the right level

411
00:19:35,919 --> 00:19:38,583
Um of on abstraction a two

412
00:19:38,583 --> 00:19:46,220
abstract um level is everything related

413
00:19:43,919 --> 00:19:49,943
if you And try uh to

414
00:19:48,784 --> 00:19:53,736
the abstraction find the level uh

415
00:19:53,008 --> 00:19:58,392
where until two information now unconnected

416
00:19:58,120 --> 00:20:01,449
can pieces be of put you

417
00:20:01,120 --> 00:20:05,826
together create something Um you new

418
00:20:05,120 --> 00:20:09,440
especially and interdisciplinary when you work

419
00:20:09,440 --> 00:20:13,376
different and into fields very like

420
00:20:12,720 --> 00:20:15,888
um medicine you need and to

421
00:20:15,344 --> 00:20:18,638
art go level to a but

422
00:20:18,264 --> 00:20:21,413
more then abstract also to um

423
00:20:21,275 --> 00:20:25,278
respppecify from that level concrete down

424
00:20:25,278 --> 00:20:27,999
to example have or a uh

425
00:20:27,600 --> 00:20:30,719
that application idea I think of

426
00:20:30,506 --> 00:20:34,704
that's are extremely where models useful

427
00:20:34,000 --> 00:20:38,266
place and have because their models

428
00:20:37,360 --> 00:20:41,709
abstractions are always from reality extremely

429
00:20:41,500 --> 00:20:43,889
but useful they uh that because

430
00:20:43,447 --> 00:20:45,716
abstract they are that not you

431
00:20:45,200 --> 00:20:48,553
with can't them anymore do anything

432
00:20:48,433 --> 00:20:50,839
You on can a reapply more

433
00:20:50,839 --> 00:20:54,639
concrete them level yeah sometimes Um

434
00:20:54,457 --> 00:20:56,433
people bit from shy too away

435
00:20:56,221 --> 00:20:58,858
abstract a little ideas ideas or

436
00:20:58,858 --> 00:21:03,407
abstract but unavoidable I think to

437
00:21:02,823 --> 00:21:05,807
it's go often that step um

438
00:21:05,807 --> 00:21:08,443
to to a more go concrete

439
00:21:07,767 --> 00:21:11,227
back level different in a Um

440
00:21:11,227 --> 00:21:15,903
yeah field that that's getting certainly

441
00:21:15,200 --> 00:21:20,760
interesting what's Yeah And and so you also are

442
00:21:20,688 --> 00:21:22,960
say only that as valuable notes

443
00:21:22,840 --> 00:21:25,440
as they're the system embedded that

444
00:21:25,164 --> 00:21:27,368
in perspective And so of from

445
00:21:27,068 --> 00:21:29,917
of a building system a zetocasten

446
00:21:29,231 --> 00:21:32,007
I know Obsidian that we and

447
00:21:31,855 --> 00:21:34,479
we Rome touched and u on

448
00:21:34,095 --> 00:21:36,331
I Lumen believe you know he

449
00:21:36,183 --> 00:21:38,446
uh he had cards these right

450
00:21:37,812 --> 00:21:39,999
index And write so he over

451
00:21:39,619 --> 00:21:41,855
was 60 able to books articles

452
00:21:41,439 --> 00:21:43,439
uh and hundreds he of had

453
00:21:43,360 --> 00:21:45,551
90 like 000 I index think

454
00:21:45,104 --> 00:21:47,786
cards some And specific there's method

455
00:21:47,284 --> 00:21:49,491
a very of notations of putting

456
00:21:49,179 --> 00:21:51,219
in like the upper to right

457
00:21:50,543 --> 00:21:53,374
to link hand corner like should

458
00:21:52,415 --> 00:21:55,642
specifically go And where a lot

459
00:21:55,535 --> 00:21:57,910
this of uh that is a

460
00:21:57,910 --> 00:22:01,460
very uh process It's very intensive

461
00:22:00,400 --> 00:22:02,951
it's very resource right to this

462
00:22:02,600 --> 00:22:04,844
create And a I system know

463
00:22:04,500 --> 00:22:07,999
like say very famous Ryan Holidayiday

464
00:22:06,450 --> 00:22:09,590
author and who in was stoicism

465
00:22:08,944 --> 00:22:11,305
a protege realm of 48 grav

466
00:22:11,112 --> 00:22:13,194
laws who of wrote power the

467
00:22:13,000 --> 00:22:15,360
He's system mentioned where he his

468
00:22:15,272 --> 00:22:17,365
he he will manually read highlights

469
00:22:16,514 --> 00:22:18,524
a book He everything book and

470
00:22:18,368 --> 00:22:19,670
in then the he book goes

471
00:22:19,447 --> 00:22:21,198
and back he through manually the

472
00:22:21,079 --> 00:22:23,456
writes single down highlight every and

473
00:22:23,120 --> 00:22:24,960
through then he that will go

474
00:22:24,588 --> 00:22:27,183
and highlight then process I think

475
00:22:26,545 --> 00:22:28,755
that allows perhaps him that's to

476
00:22:28,665 --> 00:22:30,551
what produce work and such extraordinary to

477
00:22:30,551 --> 00:22:33,371
be such a also deep that's

478
00:22:32,567 --> 00:22:35,519
thinker it's but very intensive resource

479
00:22:35,340 --> 00:22:37,061
You something know it's it's that

480
00:22:37,020 --> 00:22:38,602
not everybody time for So has

481
00:22:38,508 --> 00:22:40,577
perhaps a lot that's of systems

482
00:22:39,932 --> 00:22:42,210
where like these Obsidian come and

483
00:22:42,030 --> 00:22:44,710
into Rome kind play of where

484
00:22:43,440 --> 00:22:47,864
process of linking make the ideas

485
00:22:44,710 --> 00:22:45,380
they

486
00:22:46,720 --> 00:22:50,238
though easier it's perhaps even at

487
00:22:49,760 --> 00:22:51,996
losing the some risk of of

488
00:22:51,608 --> 00:22:55,141
that thinking internal creative around yourself

489
00:22:54,304 --> 00:22:57,585
linking Um these which ideas can

490
00:22:57,585 --> 00:23:00,726
itself some new ideas spawn instead

491
00:23:00,029 --> 00:23:02,703
some system of just do letting

492
00:23:01,879 --> 00:23:04,000
it for a you Um question

493
00:23:03,531 --> 00:23:05,200
so I is guess kind of

494
00:23:05,183 --> 00:23:06,400
the what is the middle the

495
00:23:06,400 --> 00:23:08,160
what ground is I somebody suppose

496
00:23:08,088 --> 00:23:09,472
like if you're Ryan Holidayiday know

497
00:23:09,472 --> 00:23:11,197
his your sole who job you

498
00:23:10,880 --> 00:23:12,850
as perhaps a writer then you

499
00:23:12,640 --> 00:23:14,920
resources have the time to be

500
00:23:14,500 --> 00:23:17,228
and manually the highlights documenting to

501
00:23:17,200 --> 00:23:19,280
to be thinking maintain about a

502
00:23:19,263 --> 00:23:21,592
them very and complex I'm wondering

503
00:23:20,840 --> 00:23:23,600
system where Um where your students

504
00:23:23,104 --> 00:23:24,728
do you in see this see

505
00:23:24,400 --> 00:23:26,681
regard most where people you who

506
00:23:26,400 --> 00:23:29,600
entrepreneurs perhaps they're perhaps perhaps they're

507
00:23:29,600 --> 00:23:32,960
writers they're or they're content influencers

508
00:23:32,186 --> 00:23:34,567
creators or and at something they

509
00:23:34,567 --> 00:23:36,858
they look like beneficial this as

510
00:23:36,858 --> 00:23:39,412
being to their process content but

511
00:23:39,408 --> 00:23:41,508
creation they don't time you have

512
00:23:41,208 --> 00:23:43,199
know all and this don't exude

513
00:23:42,984 --> 00:23:44,316
want all to of their ex

514
00:23:44,320 --> 00:23:46,079
trying mental to energy create and

515
00:23:45,882 --> 00:23:48,261
these between relationships these different of

516
00:23:48,261 --> 00:23:49,836
what ideas do So you kind

517
00:23:49,764 --> 00:23:51,496
what what do do you you

518
00:23:51,267 --> 00:23:54,352
say recommend there and Um slightly

519
00:23:53,705 --> 00:23:57,012
I look differently at it can

520
00:23:55,960 --> 00:23:59,198
Um I set think you up

521
00:23:58,640 --> 00:24:01,365
on a this weekend system and

522
00:24:01,365 --> 00:24:04,688
get going still You you're learning

523
00:24:04,640 --> 00:24:06,896
have along to adjust the way

524
00:24:06,820 --> 00:24:09,000
the and system you it and

525
00:24:08,684 --> 00:24:11,832
never in a finishes way learning

526
00:24:11,420 --> 00:24:14,216
So how I'm to still apply

527
00:24:14,159 --> 00:24:16,719
to it my and modify needs

528
00:24:16,600 --> 00:24:20,520
it because and the my structure

529
00:24:18,639 --> 00:24:22,512
thinking develops changes has an So

530
00:24:22,346 --> 00:24:24,638
effect uh it on notes the

531
00:24:24,638 --> 00:24:27,110
way but I the structure basic

532
00:24:27,110 --> 00:24:31,244
setup my you that allows whenever

533
00:24:31,244 --> 00:24:34,494
you have an into idea a

534
00:24:34,052 --> 00:24:37,729
to designated put them it's space

535
00:24:37,439 --> 00:24:41,279
not where lost you know but

536
00:24:40,320 --> 00:24:46,480
used to can build be something

537
00:24:43,840 --> 00:24:47,867
that doesn't need bigger more than

538
00:24:47,867 --> 00:24:51,305
a an weekend extended or The

539
00:24:51,262 --> 00:24:55,023
weekend main difference think you uh

540
00:24:55,023 --> 00:24:58,673
is describe in regard I input

541
00:24:57,348 --> 00:25:00,067
to what kind you of deal

542
00:24:59,679 --> 00:25:04,820
Holidayiday with When Ryan of reads course

543
00:25:04,479 --> 00:25:09,255
Zenica he needs through more time

544
00:25:08,391 --> 00:25:11,916
a uh book to and go

545
00:25:11,376 --> 00:25:18,360
ponder sentences about within the text

546
00:25:15,783 --> 00:25:21,729
context of the I like to say literature when

547
00:25:21,729 --> 00:25:24,591
you write note so a the

548
00:25:24,080 --> 00:25:26,151
an account note that of the

549
00:25:25,775 --> 00:25:29,310
gives literature processing um you're I'm

550
00:25:29,310 --> 00:25:33,467
often asked what's well your regular

551
00:25:32,660 --> 00:25:34,992
what's time Um too am long

552
00:25:34,730 --> 00:25:36,436
I Am taking I going it

553
00:25:36,436 --> 00:25:38,960
And the too correct fast through

554
00:25:38,180 --> 00:25:40,373
answer well is it of it

555
00:25:39,924 --> 00:25:42,728
course depends literature on the kind

556
00:25:42,666 --> 00:25:45,776
you're of appropriate working amount with

557
00:25:45,776 --> 00:25:48,920
The to spend literature on writing

558
00:25:48,014 --> 00:25:50,967
note is a somewhere second and

559
00:25:50,704 --> 00:25:53,003
between a lifetime a people I

560
00:25:53,003 --> 00:25:55,520
mean there who who are read

561
00:25:55,039 --> 00:25:58,487
their the Bible year for life

562
00:25:58,080 --> 00:26:01,935
all and things still And find

563
00:26:01,333 --> 00:26:04,523
I'm new sure um Ryan has

564
00:26:03,946 --> 00:26:08,833
Holidayiday read Zenica because um more

565
00:26:08,833 --> 00:26:12,194
than he once finds um angles

566
00:26:12,194 --> 00:26:16,010
to it with experience a different

567
00:26:12,426 --> 00:26:13,599
new

568
00:26:15,231 --> 00:26:17,947
Um you life often encounters have

569
00:26:17,824 --> 00:26:20,139
with these ideas Yeah where yeah

570
00:26:19,931 --> 00:26:23,439
you okay think that's And interesting

571
00:26:21,796 --> 00:26:25,718
a few years again later and

572
00:26:25,372 --> 00:26:27,996
you suddenly open the book it

573
00:26:27,760 --> 00:26:31,032
I hits you understand oh now

574
00:26:31,039 --> 00:26:35,600
with my experience um now and

575
00:26:34,999 --> 00:26:37,639
I the I see relevance the

576
00:26:37,639 --> 00:26:41,838
depth something of that or and

577
00:26:41,760 --> 00:26:44,715
you you grasp read page the

578
00:26:44,097 --> 00:26:47,075
one It's idea actually from title

579
00:26:46,406 --> 00:26:48,715
already and the in rest the

580
00:26:48,449 --> 00:26:50,739
of variation the book is just

581
00:26:50,424 --> 00:26:52,464
on a the and same over

582
00:26:52,128 --> 00:26:54,400
idea again over and So over

583
00:26:54,360 --> 00:26:58,240
you read don't it need twice

584
00:26:56,888 --> 00:27:00,892
to it maybe all Um so

585
00:27:00,160 --> 00:27:04,265
just I skim think through how

586
00:27:04,000 --> 00:27:07,455
have much time to you spend um

587
00:27:07,455 --> 00:27:12,703
creating the on system writing developing

588
00:27:11,520 --> 00:27:15,440
your notes it connecting really them

589
00:27:14,912 --> 00:27:18,016
depends with And on there what

590
00:27:18,016 --> 00:27:22,799
you're are dealing some some highlight

591
00:27:21,656 --> 00:27:25,701
books a lot I and because

592
00:27:24,476 --> 00:27:27,771
go through I twice feel I

593
00:27:27,279 --> 00:27:30,532
account can't on give what's a

594
00:27:30,404 --> 00:27:33,143
in proper there haven't before read

595
00:27:33,143 --> 00:27:35,599
the I the whole some pieces

596
00:27:34,775 --> 00:27:37,628
bit because of sense information after

597
00:27:37,519 --> 00:27:39,920
only you make know what's chapter

598
00:27:39,256 --> 00:27:41,360
in the and last beginning then

599
00:27:41,360 --> 00:27:44,344
go back And then to there

600
00:27:43,520 --> 00:27:45,332
the like are I articles said

601
00:27:45,332 --> 00:27:47,516
where information you have all the

602
00:27:47,520 --> 00:27:52,421
already in the So it's title it's

603
00:27:52,421 --> 00:27:54,924
possible to spend love as I

604
00:27:54,863 --> 00:27:56,310
I love I what second you

605
00:27:56,310 --> 00:27:58,158
said to you a know a

606
00:27:57,731 --> 00:28:00,199
lifetime over in a terms note

607
00:28:00,199 --> 00:28:03,599
and of going thinking specific about

608
00:28:03,419 --> 00:28:05,786
idea uh And a mentioned so

609
00:28:05,786 --> 00:28:08,619
now a we've few times and

610
00:28:08,619 --> 00:28:10,459
I like believe Rome obsidian you

611
00:28:10,459 --> 00:28:12,759
now on teach Obsidian a a

612
00:28:12,303 --> 00:28:14,767
but course before that I I'd

613
00:28:14,308 --> 00:28:16,399
ask love you about to ask

614
00:28:16,320 --> 00:28:18,575
the you about most common kind

615
00:28:18,575 --> 00:28:21,052
of methods people of that today

616
00:28:20,858 --> 00:28:22,596
perhaps can use uh system or

617
00:28:22,596 --> 00:28:24,919
build like this a I popular

618
00:28:24,114 --> 00:28:26,657
think we tools have Evernotes like

619
00:28:26,657 --> 00:28:29,189
like Google notion Docs there I'm

620
00:28:29,145 --> 00:28:31,195
uh wondering so say besides is

621
00:28:31,010 --> 00:28:33,520
Obsidian suppose which is I probably

622
00:28:32,880 --> 00:28:34,912
the the looked one of at

623
00:28:34,912 --> 00:28:36,976
is the like best the versions

624
00:28:36,383 --> 00:28:40,188
built of based of Zillow specifically

625
00:28:38,959 --> 00:28:42,379
caston system on the Uh possibility

626
00:28:41,356 --> 00:28:43,272
do you see of using the

627
00:28:43,279 --> 00:28:45,676
tools any of these like Evernote other

628
00:28:45,679 --> 00:28:48,639
Docs uh as notion being Google

629
00:28:47,631 --> 00:28:50,559
able to build system such a

630
00:28:50,559 --> 00:28:54,204
Well within some people be use

631
00:28:54,145 --> 00:28:56,965
happy them and with seem it

632
00:28:56,391 --> 00:29:00,519
to Um myself I can't uh

633
00:28:59,785 --> 00:29:04,495
imagine working apps with that not

634
00:29:04,495 --> 00:29:09,679
designed are for interconnectedness where but

635
00:29:09,392 --> 00:29:13,520
you build have your own to

636
00:29:12,208 --> 00:29:16,500
little workarounds in the end often

637
00:29:15,371 --> 00:29:18,101
and um they system apply like

638
00:29:18,101 --> 00:29:22,520
Luman a similar did where um

639
00:29:20,536 --> 00:29:24,496
you manually um ID pieces of

640
00:29:24,496 --> 00:29:27,776
information them manually and and I

641
00:29:27,616 --> 00:29:31,296
link feel from that uh distracts

642
00:29:29,744 --> 00:29:33,504
the content me So thankful I'm

643
00:29:33,504 --> 00:29:37,903
extremely for um the Obidian people

644
00:29:37,889 --> 00:29:44,279
and who developed Rome research um

645
00:29:42,146 --> 00:29:47,807
just to push the development takingaking of

646
00:29:47,807 --> 00:29:50,608
these apps um into note a

647
00:29:50,080 --> 00:30:00,480
Um new direction I feel it and

648
00:29:56,195 --> 00:30:02,112
um it's almost take like the

649
00:30:01,720 --> 00:30:05,035
you um um foot from you

650
00:30:04,560 --> 00:30:08,284
the it's brake so much smoother

651
00:30:07,008 --> 00:30:09,888
and um when and you you

652
00:30:09,582 --> 00:30:11,760
can have link the have back

653
00:30:11,333 --> 00:30:13,632
to link worry and about you

654
00:30:13,598 --> 00:30:16,316
iding don't and that stuff like

655
00:30:16,320 --> 00:30:20,551
So I feel that there was from

656
00:30:20,283 --> 00:30:22,204
a apps big that shift were

657
00:30:22,204 --> 00:30:26,000
mainly um collecting designed for information

658
00:30:24,960 --> 00:30:33,918
information storing um folder um based

659
00:30:33,679 --> 00:30:37,204
and yeah you can you something can

660
00:30:37,204 --> 00:30:42,124
certainly do with I them but

661
00:30:41,460 --> 00:30:46,843
feel um there was a breakthrough digital

662
00:30:46,560 --> 00:30:48,480
uh I for always in the

663
00:30:48,347 --> 00:30:51,356
struggled there are um some because

664
00:30:50,944 --> 00:30:53,481
elements working of with the pen

665
00:30:53,408 --> 00:30:55,680
analog and paper much I um

666
00:30:55,602 --> 00:30:57,760
I I like still so digitally miss

667
00:30:57,760 --> 00:31:01,160
them when I work generation but

668
00:31:01,160 --> 00:31:04,130
now of with apps I this

669
00:31:03,548 --> 00:31:09,640
feel new the advantages um are

670
00:31:10,640 --> 00:31:16,119
are so obvious that um the disadvantages of

671
00:31:16,119 --> 00:31:22,048
the um digital slightly fade background

672
00:31:20,920 --> 00:31:24,016
in the Um you into I

673
00:31:23,890 --> 00:31:27,653
the still spatiality miss the the

674
00:31:27,653 --> 00:31:31,517
haptics of the kind it of

675
00:31:31,517 --> 00:31:40,559
writing the that's undistracted really Um

676
00:31:36,720 --> 00:31:41,159
that you can still do but

677
00:31:40,992 --> 00:31:43,128
that it's Um then outside but

678
00:31:43,128 --> 00:31:46,559
it's of yeah the system Um

679
00:31:46,559 --> 00:31:50,976
Right And so Obsidian like seems the

680
00:31:50,976 --> 00:31:53,128
main like feature the Uh if

681
00:31:52,928 --> 00:31:55,367
I'm you wondering can describe case

682
00:31:55,081 --> 00:31:56,828
kind or of or your some

683
00:31:56,545 --> 00:31:58,839
use of heard the best from

684
00:31:58,289 --> 00:32:01,839
cases other you've people Obsidian in

685
00:32:01,476 --> 00:32:04,566
specifically terms of uh how is

686
00:32:04,240 --> 00:32:06,420
the is best uh methods one

687
00:32:06,157 --> 00:32:08,287
for of for link helping ideas

688
00:32:08,074 --> 00:32:09,535
them C to Can like you

689
00:32:09,479 --> 00:32:11,199
the kind the of visual describe

690
00:32:11,200 --> 00:32:13,024
kind mapping of what feature you

691
00:32:12,999 --> 00:32:15,309
and think Obsidian really itself stand

692
00:32:14,848 --> 00:32:16,553
makes out for Zettocast for the

693
00:32:16,559 --> 00:32:20,047
The weird system thing reason is

694
00:32:20,047 --> 00:32:22,953
I think I the like main

695
00:32:22,960 --> 00:32:27,172
really Obsidian hard to is describe

696
00:32:26,320 --> 00:32:29,278
just the It's feeling um it's

697
00:32:29,005 --> 00:32:32,335
of your being thoughts immersed with

698
00:32:32,335 --> 00:32:35,391
it in wrong while research I

699
00:32:35,391 --> 00:32:38,363
used for it a while but

700
00:32:38,363 --> 00:32:41,991
I and I always liked um

701
00:32:41,669 --> 00:32:45,799
felt distant like almost from it

702
00:32:45,799 --> 00:32:51,367
It's outside almost and like looking

703
00:32:49,607 --> 00:32:55,596
I'm and at have my notes

704
00:32:53,529 --> 00:33:00,616
to apply um prefrontal a cortex

705
00:32:59,470 --> 00:33:03,960
more like all approach and to

706
00:33:03,960 --> 00:33:08,034
it obsidian um more fades into

707
00:33:08,034 --> 00:33:11,269
the tool background and I as

708
00:33:10,878 --> 00:33:14,743
feel a much thoughts more immersed

709
00:33:13,821 --> 00:33:18,576
So in my because my theory

710
00:33:17,249 --> 00:33:22,181
it allows is it's you better

711
00:33:20,709 --> 00:33:25,034
to use by your having screen

712
00:33:24,732 --> 00:33:28,984
multiple stacking notes them by open

713
00:33:28,143 --> 00:33:32,799
um going by through more quickly

714
00:33:32,125 --> 00:33:37,491
different um and thereby notes having

715
00:33:37,491 --> 00:33:42,384
some orientation kind of Um and

716
00:33:42,384 --> 00:33:47,376
the way I teach the customers title

717
00:33:47,376 --> 00:33:53,639
of very obsidian much tries focus

718
00:33:53,639 --> 00:33:58,335
on building to that experience kind

719
00:33:58,335 --> 00:34:00,936
of of having within an your

720
00:34:00,759 --> 00:34:04,250
orientation notes despite to of stumbling the

721
00:34:04,250 --> 00:34:07,512
chances um upon to get something as

722
00:34:07,512 --> 00:34:10,740
close as original possible set to

723
00:34:10,415 --> 00:34:13,160
of the customer pen experience and

724
00:34:13,007 --> 00:34:22,320
with paper And that needs structure

725
00:34:19,238 --> 00:34:26,188
some that um took me a

726
00:34:26,188 --> 00:34:31,088
while Obsidian to is figure not

727
00:34:31,023 --> 00:34:35,376
out a So tool you can

728
00:34:32,960 --> 00:34:41,759
just use and main advantage Its

729
00:34:35,376 --> 00:34:36,448
open

730
00:34:40,912 --> 00:34:45,152
is at biggest the same time

731
00:34:44,511 --> 00:34:48,636
risk its You do almost can

732
00:34:47,656 --> 00:34:50,416
anything use with it it and

733
00:34:50,159 --> 00:34:53,199
in you all can and kinds

734
00:34:52,912 --> 00:34:56,424
if of ways you have figured

735
00:34:55,696 --> 00:35:00,400
don't out a good structure you're um

736
00:35:00,400 --> 00:35:04,936
And so what I try lost to

737
00:35:04,936 --> 00:35:09,480
um provide experience is the based

738
00:35:08,720 --> 00:35:12,328
allows structure you to quickly that

739
00:35:12,328 --> 00:35:15,480
then u thoughts focus instead on

740
00:35:15,480 --> 00:35:18,212
your of about thinking how to

741
00:35:17,828 --> 00:35:19,751
too set much it it up

742
00:35:19,751 --> 00:35:23,120
how to structure And for some

743
00:35:23,120 --> 00:35:25,520
it goes a little the bit

744
00:35:25,520 --> 00:35:30,028
against bottom up approach where of

745
00:35:30,028 --> 00:35:33,118
the you set develop of custom

746
00:35:32,530 --> 00:35:36,020
structure the bottom from up uh

747
00:35:35,328 --> 00:35:38,052
and you from collect how they

748
00:35:37,537 --> 00:35:40,512
nodes fit see together out okay

749
00:35:40,051 --> 00:35:44,448
and what's then figure the structure

750
00:35:42,720 --> 00:35:45,760
how do these here things um

751
00:35:45,760 --> 00:35:49,216
because belong you together you already

752
00:35:48,320 --> 00:35:51,520
kind of start hierarchy with some

753
00:35:51,520 --> 00:35:58,880
but top it down doesn't um

754
00:35:56,079 --> 00:36:01,520
hardwire anything into can this always

755
00:36:00,185 --> 00:36:04,160
system change You when your the

756
00:36:03,614 --> 00:36:07,612
thinking structure changes because way the

757
00:36:07,612 --> 00:36:09,519
way in we think a way

758
00:36:09,237 --> 00:36:11,919
about we structure things is things

759
00:36:11,269 --> 00:36:13,119
the to So change it it

760
00:36:13,119 --> 00:36:16,048
needs something done with a that

761
00:36:15,663 --> 00:36:19,184
classical couldn't be folder Um but

762
00:36:18,571 --> 00:36:23,560
structure I think when it's people

763
00:36:21,713 --> 00:36:27,200
justified start because cast with and

764
00:36:26,800 --> 00:36:30,335
they obsidian don't start from don't

765
00:36:29,632 --> 00:36:31,964
scratch have Um to you pretend

766
00:36:31,520 --> 00:36:34,877
You you don't know nothing structure

767
00:36:33,599 --> 00:36:36,555
you have to your build thoughts

768
00:36:36,555 --> 00:36:39,028
Um it already first have We

769
00:36:38,799 --> 00:36:41,039
an always idea how things we

770
00:36:41,039 --> 00:36:43,644
structure Um we have different interest

771
00:36:43,644 --> 00:36:46,416
or areas different of responsibility areas

772
00:36:46,416 --> 00:36:51,353
of we um have different questions makes

773
00:36:51,353 --> 00:36:54,616
sense So to it start make

774
00:36:53,935 --> 00:36:57,033
at the this beginning structure to

775
00:36:57,040 --> 00:37:03,315
Uh use it explicit as the

776
00:37:03,315 --> 00:37:08,336
scaffold add new ideas you can

777
00:37:08,020 --> 00:37:13,503
onto then and needs change changing

778
00:37:12,441 --> 00:37:16,431
it Um when and it this

779
00:37:15,760 --> 00:37:23,439
is structure something in that my

780
00:37:22,160 --> 00:37:26,960
um is opinion to some degree

781
00:37:26,960 --> 00:37:30,960
an the alternative haptic orientation to

782
00:37:30,736 --> 00:37:33,703
you analog have with the So

783
00:37:33,703 --> 00:37:37,410
in set the analog okay um

784
00:37:36,996 --> 00:37:40,870
set my you my always notes

785
00:37:40,289 --> 00:37:43,865
knew on thinking on writing are

786
00:37:43,865 --> 00:37:48,441
somewhere and bottom drawer on the

787
00:37:47,760 --> 00:37:50,320
and um left I the kind

788
00:37:50,320 --> 00:37:53,380
of notes know how um feel

789
00:37:52,901 --> 00:37:56,396
used because them so often of

790
00:37:56,207 --> 00:37:58,851
or a you beloved know it

791
00:37:58,224 --> 00:38:01,264
burke was you where you kind

792
00:38:00,770 --> 00:38:03,270
the of things know that are

793
00:38:03,226 --> 00:38:06,211
in um you the don't digital

794
00:38:05,770 --> 00:38:08,449
have form other but means you

795
00:38:08,449 --> 00:38:12,353
have of uh orientation within Some

796
00:38:12,353 --> 00:38:16,123
of obsidian them are but built

797
00:38:16,123 --> 00:38:21,050
in most of them you need or to

798
00:38:20,940 --> 00:38:24,527
use create um yourself a preconfigured uh

799
00:38:24,527 --> 00:38:29,221
structure you can adjust then to

800
00:38:28,655 --> 00:38:32,072
tweak your own and needs that's

801
00:38:31,489 --> 00:38:36,544
Um I that's think the ingenious

802
00:38:34,100 --> 00:38:39,226
challenge of uh these apps uh

803
00:38:38,400 --> 00:38:42,112
that that they are at so

804
00:38:41,358 --> 00:38:44,840
the open same restrict time uh

805
00:38:44,556 --> 00:38:47,754
you the openness need again to

806
00:38:47,760 --> 00:38:53,132
own with your ideas Yeah I

807
00:38:52,880 --> 00:38:55,363
Yeah I think one perhaps way

808
00:38:55,363 --> 00:38:57,964
of looking is that at Obsidian

809
00:38:57,148 --> 00:39:01,119
it kind itself of the foundation to but be then

810
00:38:59,019 --> 00:39:00,074
provides

811
00:39:00,689 --> 00:39:02,488
the architect you need and how

812
00:39:02,215 --> 00:39:04,440
decide are you you know foundation going

813
00:39:04,440 --> 00:39:06,392
to and build I know on

814
00:39:06,159 --> 00:39:08,188
I that I tried first to

815
00:39:07,971 --> 00:39:09,932
time use I Obsidian overwhelmed I

816
00:39:09,932 --> 00:39:12,032
was and completely I I was

817
00:39:11,680 --> 00:39:13,382
too like much this for is

818
00:39:13,252 --> 00:39:15,348
me way because approach it you

819
00:39:15,255 --> 00:39:16,784
um have it's to not tool

820
00:39:16,671 --> 00:39:18,320
it's like not Evernote like or

821
00:39:18,087 --> 00:39:19,904
a Google everything Docs where is

822
00:39:19,904 --> 00:39:21,248
kind of like laid if out

823
00:39:21,216 --> 00:39:22,680
you and it's you going you

824
00:39:22,680 --> 00:39:24,120
know to that put you're a

825
00:39:24,120 --> 00:39:26,320
note into a a notebook folder

826
00:39:25,960 --> 00:39:28,160
and and that's or provide that's

827
00:39:27,968 --> 00:39:30,704
the they structure they the architects

828
00:39:29,504 --> 00:39:31,413
you know they are of it

829
00:39:31,120 --> 00:39:32,905
that comes system to and the

830
00:39:32,784 --> 00:39:34,397
when is system having whether a

831
00:39:34,397 --> 00:39:36,440
zilloccast you're using a software an

832
00:39:36,440 --> 00:39:38,523
analog version or having is that

833
00:39:38,407 --> 00:39:40,180
to you develop are still the

834
00:39:40,180 --> 00:39:42,320
structure you are storing of this

835
00:39:41,953 --> 00:39:43,984
how information I think Obsidian and

836
00:39:43,984 --> 00:39:45,338
now and they Rome try you

837
00:39:45,280 --> 00:39:46,600
to know they take because some

838
00:39:46,600 --> 00:39:48,283
of I that think out so

839
00:39:47,934 --> 00:39:50,100
what popular allows is them their

840
00:39:49,418 --> 00:39:51,220
to be kind kind of of

841
00:39:50,826 --> 00:39:53,870
intuitive visual birectional linking linking it's

842
00:39:53,870 --> 00:39:55,865
like system you can where create

843
00:39:55,650 --> 00:39:57,854
where these between these links your

844
00:39:57,854 --> 00:39:59,686
notes that go back love and

845
00:39:59,344 --> 00:40:02,064
the forth the mind And mapping

846
00:40:01,060 --> 00:40:03,626
I And I functionality think a

847
00:40:03,626 --> 00:40:05,656
tool a probably tool like the

848
00:40:05,310 --> 00:40:07,490
this closest is right that now

849
00:40:07,072 --> 00:40:08,960
we of can having get to

850
00:40:08,820 --> 00:40:10,593
an of interior your brain view

851
00:40:10,593 --> 00:40:11,940
of And I why think it

852
00:40:11,940 --> 00:40:14,192
resonates that that's so people so

853
00:40:14,192 --> 00:40:16,240
much because with so many it's

854
00:40:16,000 --> 00:40:18,416
structure the the way is that

855
00:40:18,093 --> 00:40:20,710
oriented the we is think closer

856
00:40:20,220 --> 00:40:22,773
than I to think how method

857
00:40:21,900 --> 00:40:24,291
any other that other has you

858
00:40:24,000 --> 00:40:25,773
thought know that of we've up

859
00:40:25,773 --> 00:40:27,856
until why now I And love

860
00:40:27,546 --> 00:40:29,823
so when that's you say feels

861
00:40:29,392 --> 00:40:32,180
that like Obsidian you're it you're

862
00:40:31,440 --> 00:40:33,636
your brain viewing in into a

863
00:40:33,599 --> 00:40:35,460
that's way Um and if that's you

864
00:40:35,460 --> 00:40:37,321
maintain not kind it of and

865
00:40:37,231 --> 00:40:39,389
uh if taken you're a decide

866
00:40:39,087 --> 00:40:40,391
back to and to just look

867
00:40:40,391 --> 00:40:42,492
elsewhere just feel so because overwhelmed

868
00:40:42,063 --> 00:40:43,833
you that's And I kind suppose

869
00:40:43,519 --> 00:40:45,384
of about what your right course

870
00:40:45,147 --> 00:40:46,455
C is can explain you kind

871
00:40:46,455 --> 00:40:48,016
of a explain little course bit

872
00:40:48,016 --> 00:40:49,800
about uh your what your you

873
00:40:49,520 --> 00:40:52,537
think teach uh and who should

874
00:40:51,688 --> 00:40:54,347
you Yeah consider I mean uh

875
00:40:53,957 --> 00:40:56,953
first signing of up all that the

876
00:40:56,953 --> 00:41:00,679
I I agree it um it

877
00:41:00,679 --> 00:41:05,299
is the closest maybe structure to

878
00:41:05,299 --> 00:41:07,910
the internally way we second So

879
00:41:07,910 --> 00:41:10,234
it brain is like but a

880
00:41:09,897 --> 00:41:11,989
I dialogue see it partner more

881
00:41:11,989 --> 00:41:15,000
as a and course that's how

882
00:41:15,000 --> 00:41:18,479
the is um build designed a

883
00:41:18,479 --> 00:41:21,951
dialogue to way partner Um and

884
00:41:21,359 --> 00:41:24,213
along I I the like the

885
00:41:24,063 --> 00:41:27,825
the dialogue metaphor partner of second

886
00:41:26,985 --> 00:41:30,660
better brain than metaphor the because

887
00:41:29,760 --> 00:41:34,864
brain the second metaphor um it

888
00:41:34,864 --> 00:41:39,088
insinuates you you But when look

889
00:41:38,895 --> 00:41:41,535
I at interact yourself with my

890
00:41:41,200 --> 00:41:43,480
I subtle don't feel cast like

891
00:41:43,119 --> 00:41:46,839
myself like with I with feel

892
00:41:43,480 --> 00:41:45,304
I'm interacting

893
00:41:46,734 --> 00:41:51,406
a like I'm different interacting me

894
00:41:50,631 --> 00:41:55,638
entity with information that challenges I

895
00:41:55,638 --> 00:41:58,595
I and I or don't I

896
00:41:58,595 --> 00:42:02,825
remember remember in the confronted moment

897
00:42:02,378 --> 00:42:04,586
with um it Uh I'm but

898
00:42:04,240 --> 00:42:06,796
of these oh um I moments

899
00:42:06,000 --> 00:42:08,264
think here you or forgot um

900
00:42:08,200 --> 00:42:11,192
something you have written before about

901
00:42:10,567 --> 00:42:13,183
and in that a or slightly

902
00:42:12,295 --> 00:42:15,276
I'd take different a literature way

903
00:42:15,280 --> 00:42:17,217
look up note a reference and

904
00:42:17,217 --> 00:42:19,211
um in well a I paper

905
00:42:18,841 --> 00:42:21,539
don't and say understand the authors

906
00:42:21,349 --> 00:42:23,591
it um like I that think

907
00:42:22,852 --> 00:42:26,156
So and they got it wrong

908
00:42:25,559 --> 00:42:28,920
so yeah so it's partner more

909
00:42:28,908 --> 00:42:31,680
and like in a the dialogue

910
00:42:30,630 --> 00:42:37,440
course the um I provide structure

911
00:42:34,079 --> 00:42:38,501
um so to not have feeling this

912
00:42:38,501 --> 00:42:44,360
overwhelming of oh um everything but

913
00:42:43,950 --> 00:42:48,000
goes okay here you have um

914
00:42:46,560 --> 00:42:49,920
your daily you note can section

915
00:42:48,852 --> 00:42:51,278
use that for When fleeting you

916
00:42:50,983 --> 00:42:53,315
notes have your an hatch idea

917
00:42:53,315 --> 00:42:56,099
that just pops write into can

918
00:42:55,583 --> 00:42:58,319
it connect down Um you it

919
00:42:58,079 --> 00:43:01,946
questions with projects or you Um

920
00:43:01,639 --> 00:43:05,277
already so it comes tackling with

921
00:43:05,200 --> 00:43:08,045
um uh vault the preconfigured with

922
00:43:08,045 --> 00:43:12,313
folders topic which folders are not

923
00:43:12,319 --> 00:43:14,851
folders um but Um are it

924
00:43:14,656 --> 00:43:18,988
functional comes with a tags selection which

925
00:43:18,988 --> 00:43:23,044
are of useful selection It comes

926
00:43:21,948 --> 00:43:25,560
of queries with a that present

927
00:43:24,652 --> 00:43:28,460
allow yourself you to open loops

928
00:43:27,359 --> 00:43:32,184
questions open in the morning when and you

929
00:43:32,136 --> 00:43:35,346
you open Obsidian know oh there

930
00:43:33,984 --> 00:43:37,680
I can continue Um but working

931
00:43:36,932 --> 00:43:41,690
I that don't would think that

932
00:43:41,016 --> 00:43:44,784
be any much of of don't

933
00:43:44,352 --> 00:43:47,688
much get use the explanation if

934
00:43:47,688 --> 00:43:50,800
you um folders why are the

935
00:43:50,292 --> 00:43:52,612
there there why what the the

936
00:43:52,281 --> 00:43:54,424
tags function are interconnects is how

937
00:43:54,424 --> 00:44:01,200
it So I hope with the course how

938
00:44:01,200 --> 00:44:06,000
you to can explain quickly build

939
00:44:04,402 --> 00:44:09,200
um routine a habit of a

940
00:44:08,548 --> 00:44:13,280
daily into this structure writing and

941
00:44:12,800 --> 00:44:15,720
to then your adjust needs Um

942
00:44:15,320 --> 00:44:18,056
it and most it people seems

943
00:44:18,056 --> 00:44:20,656
like just as go it with

944
00:44:20,400 --> 00:44:23,920
is the and structure are able

945
00:44:23,760 --> 00:44:27,440
academic to use writing it for

946
00:44:27,050 --> 00:44:33,120
but um also for more looking

947
00:44:33,120 --> 00:44:37,600
things up um keeping projects track

948
00:44:37,600 --> 00:44:44,797
of um and having information available readily

949
00:44:44,800 --> 00:44:50,296
yeah so I Um think skipping it's

950
00:44:50,296 --> 00:44:54,876
a lot about this long um

951
00:44:54,880 --> 00:45:00,532
figuring process stuff of out um

952
00:44:59,599 --> 00:45:05,384
um conserve trying the to advantages

953
00:45:03,359 --> 00:45:07,091
original set casten of the in

954
00:45:07,040 --> 00:45:12,835
um digital form that the students

955
00:45:12,835 --> 00:45:16,800
or users go ers don't through

956
00:45:16,105 --> 00:45:18,558
have to this of long um

957
00:45:18,558 --> 00:45:23,599
developing iteration a process structure not

958
00:45:23,315 --> 00:45:26,039
that just works in the long

959
00:45:25,516 --> 00:45:28,713
beginning term So I but in

960
00:45:28,079 --> 00:45:32,575
have the thousand It's of pretty

961
00:45:30,799 --> 00:45:39,037
notes And complex some some things

962
00:45:39,037 --> 00:45:42,900
I only after realized I went

963
00:45:42,900 --> 00:45:45,571
through 10 or this 20 threshold 000

964
00:45:45,571 --> 00:45:49,996
individual of notes realize where you

965
00:45:50,000 --> 00:45:54,112
you oh you need complexity to

966
00:45:54,112 --> 00:45:57,359
deal in with a this way

967
00:45:57,200 --> 00:45:59,525
would um have that been so

968
00:45:59,119 --> 00:46:01,385
that much in easier the if

969
00:46:01,015 --> 00:46:04,177
beginning I knew that's Um so

970
00:46:04,177 --> 00:46:07,649
I that's think with what with

971
00:46:07,339 --> 00:46:10,351
I this hope um with to

972
00:46:10,004 --> 00:46:12,359
this achieve course

973
00:46:12,880 --> 00:46:16,280
right And I think you've that

974
00:46:16,280 --> 00:46:18,443
the said moment before you as

975
00:46:18,360 --> 00:46:20,536
stop just treating storage notes and

976
00:46:20,536 --> 00:46:23,153
start dialogue seeing your your them

977
00:46:22,913 --> 00:46:25,355
thinking as I shifts think And

978
00:46:24,880 --> 00:46:27,680
that's component that's the of powerful

979
00:46:27,249 --> 00:46:29,192
uh this having It's a not

980
00:46:29,138 --> 00:46:32,720
system necessarily like everybody something for

981
00:46:32,629 --> 00:46:35,480
It's something not necessarily that's easy

982
00:46:35,480 --> 00:46:37,320
to to even set maintain up

983
00:46:37,320 --> 00:46:40,719
um or because constant it requires

984
00:46:39,573 --> 00:46:42,904
effort habit You have of to

985
00:46:42,508 --> 00:46:45,300
regularly have a are creating not

986
00:46:45,300 --> 00:46:47,760
just notes notes that in but

987
00:46:47,421 --> 00:46:50,073
terms in in of terms quantity

988
00:46:49,680 --> 00:46:51,759
of some quality kind and of

989
00:46:51,600 --> 00:46:54,922
having sufficient routine method where you

990
00:46:54,559 --> 00:46:57,263
or are this frequently system and

991
00:46:56,812 --> 00:46:59,407
using that's your brain the only

992
00:46:59,099 --> 00:47:01,056
is way going that to to

993
00:47:00,884 --> 00:47:03,936
trust maintain this a system certain

994
00:47:03,119 --> 00:47:05,639
knowledge set of that outside you

995
00:47:05,639 --> 00:47:08,159
will be to more reference likely

996
00:47:08,160 --> 00:47:10,219
mistake because of I've having made

997
00:47:10,160 --> 00:47:11,552
say the an that Evernote I

998
00:47:11,552 --> 00:47:14,048
tried system to Thiagoforte's build on

999
00:47:14,048 --> 00:47:17,251
Thiago projects par method areas We

1000
00:47:17,152 --> 00:47:19,447
resources have then I archives end

1001
00:47:19,447 --> 00:47:21,868
up just and forgetting there And

1002
00:47:21,868 --> 00:47:24,552
my that first it's default information

1003
00:47:24,048 --> 00:47:26,275
if I on need a Google

1004
00:47:25,452 --> 00:47:27,649
subject or was now to it's

1005
00:47:27,253 --> 00:47:29,023
go just to to like go

1006
00:47:28,654 --> 00:47:31,124
a and a create deep research

1007
00:47:30,400 --> 00:47:32,704
chat GPT query and inside I

1008
00:47:32,704 --> 00:47:34,973
I of haven't created necessarily a

1009
00:47:34,973 --> 00:47:38,256
habit of notes let me first

1010
00:47:37,263 --> 00:47:39,304
look at my and previously see

1011
00:47:39,304 --> 00:47:41,466
what I've what read thoughts It's

1012
00:47:41,466 --> 00:47:43,810
so I've easy created to just

1013
00:47:43,440 --> 00:47:46,154
thinking kind of shift have your

1014
00:47:45,584 --> 00:47:47,788
to extern looking for externally it

1015
00:47:47,788 --> 00:47:50,185
instead of seeing intrinsically what you

1016
00:47:50,185 --> 00:47:51,628
already there's have a because good

1017
00:47:51,628 --> 00:47:53,192
chance to that have you're some

1018
00:47:52,863 --> 00:47:56,167
going golden that nuggets you haven't

1019
00:47:54,888 --> 00:47:58,273
in there I thought totally of

1020
00:47:58,273 --> 00:48:02,532
before agree Um I It's think

1021
00:48:01,584 --> 00:48:06,097
not for anyone everyone who expect

1022
00:48:05,200 --> 00:48:08,689
proficient to be as as Lumen

1023
00:48:08,240 --> 00:48:11,596
uh and creating suddenly an start

1024
00:48:10,973 --> 00:48:14,389
output a month of a few

1025
00:48:13,747 --> 00:48:18,043
um articles will be because disappointed

1026
00:48:18,043 --> 00:48:24,676
um you still need think to

1027
00:48:24,676 --> 00:48:31,941
read and write have the discipline

1028
00:48:30,079 --> 00:48:39,440
um to have a routine of um these practicing

1029
00:48:39,440 --> 00:48:46,503
all If things you think seriously

1030
00:48:44,560 --> 00:48:48,927
and take if thinking you read

1031
00:48:48,927 --> 00:48:51,520
things for the joy not of

1032
00:48:51,351 --> 00:48:54,720
just reading intention but with the

1033
00:48:54,363 --> 00:48:58,120
of using using the the ideas

1034
00:48:57,300 --> 00:49:01,520
information and challenges and or um

1035
00:49:01,232 --> 00:49:07,504
article a book to provides challenge

1036
00:49:07,504 --> 00:49:11,344
your own um thinking looking your

1037
00:49:10,995 --> 00:49:13,813
at way the of world your

1038
00:49:13,813 --> 00:49:17,275
goal if regardless if that is

1039
00:49:17,280 --> 00:49:21,377
you're of the aiming output for

1040
00:49:21,280 --> 00:49:24,121
it's I a think method that

1041
00:49:23,839 --> 00:49:25,825
kinds can of work different for

1042
00:49:25,825 --> 00:49:27,616
all people have Uh you to

1043
00:49:27,303 --> 00:49:30,048
don't be to an um academic

1044
00:49:29,178 --> 00:49:31,534
have the You aim don't of

1045
00:49:31,534 --> 00:49:40,240
writing have the I think common

1046
00:49:36,319 --> 00:49:42,079
advantage is that it challenge allows

1047
00:49:42,079 --> 00:49:44,175
you your to own thinking much

1048
00:49:44,175 --> 00:49:47,452
easier and it's to so change

1049
00:49:46,720 --> 00:49:50,656
you have your it thinking externalized

1050
00:49:49,418 --> 00:49:52,624
when look first at your When

1051
00:49:52,239 --> 00:49:54,999
thoughts you so in so writing much

1052
00:49:54,999 --> 00:49:57,999
easier it's to that detect or

1053
00:49:57,864 --> 00:50:02,319
the contradictions flaws in pieces between

1054
00:50:01,404 --> 00:50:05,136
of uh information written down you

1055
00:50:02,319 --> 00:50:03,039
two

1056
00:50:04,799 --> 00:50:06,718
You have you when just you

1057
00:50:06,557 --> 00:50:08,634
detect look at it that But

1058
00:50:08,319 --> 00:50:10,071
only it's in if your it's

1059
00:50:09,909 --> 00:50:12,559
brain something if you and read

1060
00:50:12,035 --> 00:50:15,023
you think that's that's Yeah interesting

1061
00:50:13,991 --> 00:50:15,727
okay read the And next then

1062
00:50:15,727 --> 00:50:17,090
you bit okay and that you

1063
00:50:17,090 --> 00:50:19,999
think convinced Yeah don't me as

1064
00:50:19,839 --> 00:50:22,716
even well realize you don't that

1065
00:50:22,716 --> 00:50:25,967
these fit together two things So

1066
00:50:25,967 --> 00:50:28,391
that it makes that it is

1067
00:50:27,759 --> 00:50:29,919
interesting what to me that's I

1068
00:50:29,919 --> 00:50:32,680
think what makes writers it relevant

1069
00:50:31,952 --> 00:50:35,232
because for something if you want

1070
00:50:35,232 --> 00:50:38,512
to original write come you up

1071
00:50:38,512 --> 00:50:41,792
with need something to a new

1072
00:50:41,177 --> 00:50:44,662
new interesting angle You um need

1073
00:50:44,662 --> 00:50:52,608
to let ideas um be enriched

1074
00:50:52,608 --> 00:50:57,200
through your Just own taking experience

1075
00:50:56,532 --> 00:51:00,556
something putting it from on paper

1076
00:50:59,589 --> 00:51:02,179
CHP and Um people that it

1077
00:51:02,179 --> 00:51:04,871
is will not see enriched experience

1078
00:51:04,299 --> 00:51:06,887
by your There between is a

1079
00:51:06,705 --> 00:51:10,158
here's difference a know piece this

1080
00:51:10,070 --> 00:51:13,436
of is information true and I

1081
00:51:12,795 --> 00:51:15,592
that being is able true to

1082
00:51:15,432 --> 00:51:18,719
and express something the relevance and

1083
00:51:18,719 --> 00:51:22,319
that of needs intervention a human

1084
00:51:21,786 --> 00:51:25,959
and expands the settle this personal

1085
00:51:25,022 --> 00:51:29,080
casten space advantage and uses of

1086
00:51:28,871 --> 00:51:34,645
the externalization to modify to develop

1087
00:51:34,645 --> 00:51:37,770
and in mature in a way

1088
00:51:37,770 --> 00:51:40,824
to your Um own so I

1089
00:51:40,024 --> 00:51:44,056
thinking agree but it's I not

1090
00:51:43,344 --> 00:51:46,105
also think for everyone it's it

1091
00:51:46,105 --> 00:51:52,800
doesn't be need to academic this

1092
00:51:50,207 --> 00:51:55,008
tool that needs the time attention For

1093
00:51:55,008 --> 00:51:58,688
me actually all um surprise that

1094
00:51:58,688 --> 00:52:01,738
might you There where are long

1095
00:52:01,266 --> 00:52:04,031
I streaks don't all open my

1096
00:52:03,896 --> 00:52:09,068
Um settle because custom at finishing

1097
00:52:06,944 --> 00:52:12,024
I'm in the the online middle

1098
00:52:11,336 --> 00:52:15,116
course of and organizational have um

1099
00:52:15,119 --> 00:52:18,255
call things people to do I

1100
00:52:18,099 --> 00:52:20,607
I I need go to on

1101
00:52:20,000 --> 00:52:22,675
so it's podcast on the back

1102
00:52:22,175 --> 00:52:24,816
Um burner didn't I start I'm

1103
00:52:24,592 --> 00:52:26,632
this I day subtle with opening

1104
00:52:26,283 --> 00:52:28,850
custom my because Now actually I

1105
00:52:28,593 --> 00:52:30,640
I for did preparation I I

1106
00:52:30,640 --> 00:52:33,676
I of of course the podcast

1107
00:52:32,880 --> 00:52:35,680
looked but into there it Um

1108
00:52:35,219 --> 00:52:38,297
are but long look periods where

1109
00:52:37,840 --> 00:52:41,599
at I don't it at the

1110
00:52:41,040 --> 00:52:44,777
and same time sudden whenever idea

1111
00:52:44,777 --> 00:52:47,759
and I I have think a

1112
00:52:47,626 --> 00:52:50,760
that's I I wouldn't relevant know

1113
00:52:50,480 --> 00:52:53,160
into where my telecast to put

1114
00:52:53,160 --> 00:52:55,458
it Um if if not I

1115
00:52:54,960 --> 00:52:58,320
somewhere just put on it paper

1116
00:52:57,599 --> 00:52:59,895
Um it it can it be

1117
00:52:59,440 --> 00:53:01,680
would an in be between lost

1118
00:53:01,680 --> 00:53:03,728
need step to know but it

1119
00:53:03,340 --> 00:53:05,776
I goes that's there the but

1120
00:53:05,577 --> 00:53:08,654
only because place an where actual

1121
00:53:08,339 --> 00:53:11,126
it difference can make me Um

1122
00:53:10,847 --> 00:53:13,388
to so pick it allows up

1123
00:53:13,388 --> 00:53:15,503
um if I where left it

1124
00:53:15,503 --> 00:53:18,361
a I couple left of weeks

1125
00:53:17,623 --> 00:53:21,606
it ago even Um I don't

1126
00:53:21,606 --> 00:53:24,616
know if Um routine to me

1127
00:53:24,282 --> 00:53:28,960
is having overrated a daily often

1128
00:53:27,778 --> 00:53:32,045
routine something is I I really

1129
00:53:31,960 --> 00:53:34,409
I like the reality idea of

1130
00:53:34,096 --> 00:53:36,122
it but it in it I'm

1131
00:53:35,800 --> 00:53:38,214
often I'm I'm doesn't on the

1132
00:53:38,072 --> 00:53:40,560
work train only my and morning

1133
00:53:39,784 --> 00:53:42,480
can't routine have sometimes at my

1134
00:53:42,480 --> 00:53:48,059
desk uh it's too noisy office

1135
00:53:46,850 --> 00:53:50,519
at home Um and I'm so

1136
00:53:49,962 --> 00:53:54,000
at in the in in my life reality at

1137
00:53:54,000 --> 00:53:57,720
least I a I daily don't

1138
00:53:57,621 --> 00:54:00,529
routine have such always uh even

1139
00:54:00,225 --> 00:54:03,387
sounds though great it it Um

1140
00:54:03,387 --> 00:54:05,283
but have a I'm system glad

1141
00:54:05,213 --> 00:54:07,430
which I kind provides of me

1142
00:54:07,126 --> 00:54:09,875
structure with a up that um

1143
00:54:09,539 --> 00:54:12,555
allows where me to I pick

1144
00:54:12,209 --> 00:54:14,608
left work it with um a

1145
00:54:14,543 --> 00:54:17,403
continue project and to sometimes a

1146
00:54:17,403 --> 00:54:21,423
project for leave a while one

1147
00:54:20,543 --> 00:54:26,799
develop further another I'm easily because

1148
00:54:24,471 --> 00:54:28,132
bored and um which want to

1149
00:54:27,698 --> 00:54:30,392
is switch maybe a with reason

1150
00:54:29,967 --> 00:54:31,739
ADHD a um lot seem of

1151
00:54:31,739 --> 00:54:34,831
people to like lot the system

1152
00:54:34,831 --> 00:54:38,480
a but yeah Um that's um

1153
00:54:38,480 --> 00:54:42,183
the long um answer to to

1154
00:54:42,183 --> 00:54:47,487
to the problem of um who's who's

1155
00:54:47,248 --> 00:54:49,476
it it not for for and

1156
00:54:49,599 --> 00:54:52,702
Yeah And perhaps having necessary a

1157
00:54:52,702 --> 00:54:55,228
routine as isn't long instinct as

1158
00:54:55,228 --> 00:54:57,240
you to have open the up

1159
00:54:57,001 --> 00:54:58,896
the the the app relevant and

1160
00:54:58,896 --> 00:55:01,723
say information add come across whenever

1161
00:55:01,344 --> 00:55:03,136
the you idea or highlight the

1162
00:55:03,136 --> 00:55:05,424
note as or quote the relevant

1163
00:55:04,599 --> 00:55:06,368
and that you to think your

1164
00:55:06,368 --> 00:55:08,256
system is of So maintaining it's

1165
00:55:08,256 --> 00:55:11,011
the act the utilizing system and

1166
00:55:10,506 --> 00:55:12,246
it when then you relation need

1167
00:55:12,192 --> 00:55:13,424
to to the in work to

1168
00:55:13,200 --> 00:55:14,950
that accomplish you're trying And I

1169
00:55:14,880 --> 00:55:16,477
only think thing that's that the

1170
00:55:16,372 --> 00:55:17,829
matters you're as not long just

1171
00:55:17,829 --> 00:55:20,610
consistently as information adding to referencing

1172
00:55:19,720 --> 00:55:21,336
it and then it not or

1173
00:55:21,200 --> 00:55:22,789
then not you're using just it

1174
00:55:22,765 --> 00:55:25,113
creating because system a a bloated

1175
00:55:24,560 --> 00:55:27,590
that you're necessarily unlikely use But

1176
00:55:27,160 --> 00:55:29,141
to but chat we've GPT now

1177
00:55:29,073 --> 00:55:31,577
mentioned a few times become and

1178
00:55:31,504 --> 00:55:33,519
very now widespread it's of AI

1179
00:55:33,394 --> 00:55:36,184
different Gemini Claude forms and what

1180
00:55:35,919 --> 00:55:38,465
I'm your wondering thoughts are terms

1181
00:55:37,880 --> 00:55:39,404
on the of matter do you

1182
00:55:39,404 --> 00:55:41,078
think in manual it could note

1183
00:55:40,969 --> 00:55:42,515
take taking over could Do you

1184
00:55:42,515 --> 00:55:45,303
think become that your obsolete students

1185
00:55:45,013 --> 00:55:47,575
Have kind you of seen using

1186
00:55:46,720 --> 00:55:49,976
you think AI it's and something

1187
00:55:48,711 --> 00:55:50,906
do replace that the Zeno that

1188
00:55:50,820 --> 00:55:53,130
castle could system think or do

1189
00:55:53,048 --> 00:55:56,674
it you At might the complement

1190
00:55:54,872 --> 00:55:58,928
moment we it treat uh chat

1191
00:55:58,928 --> 00:56:04,960
chipity AI or in a um

1192
00:56:03,140 --> 00:56:08,160
way that's and too too internal

1193
00:56:07,500 --> 00:56:11,360
external at the think same time

1194
00:56:11,360 --> 00:56:15,038
So our I thinking still is

1195
00:56:15,040 --> 00:56:20,288
very much tied to what philosophers the

1196
00:56:20,288 --> 00:56:27,232
representational call area where we think of the an

1197
00:56:26,449 --> 00:56:31,168
brain entity um as um that

1198
00:56:29,987 --> 00:56:33,396
separate is from It's the like

1199
00:56:33,396 --> 00:56:36,144
a world processor the that uh

1200
00:56:35,786 --> 00:56:39,305
information deals with information coming in

1201
00:56:39,305 --> 00:56:42,340
and then recently goes out we

1202
00:56:42,340 --> 00:56:46,680
start again understanding And only the

1203
00:56:47,119 --> 00:56:53,200
impact a different about kind thinking

1204
00:56:51,823 --> 00:56:55,480
of thinking can matters have on

1205
00:56:55,206 --> 00:56:58,450
So practical if we think as

1206
00:56:58,450 --> 00:57:02,180
something about thinking that happens well

1207
00:57:02,180 --> 00:57:06,287
as externally internally as within that

1208
00:57:06,287 --> 00:57:10,987
we our really environment think with

1209
00:57:10,400 --> 00:57:13,399
we our tools

1210
00:57:13,920 --> 00:57:20,687
I think shift the whole discussion if

1211
00:57:20,687 --> 00:57:24,582
you Um think brains we um

1212
00:57:23,756 --> 00:57:27,243
only think you tend with to

1213
00:57:26,825 --> 00:57:29,519
our see replacement AI as of

1214
00:57:29,519 --> 00:57:32,399
our a thinking um process We

1215
00:57:32,400 --> 00:57:37,737
use AI to think for And

1216
00:57:37,464 --> 00:57:41,445
us that's instead obviously think a

1217
00:57:41,445 --> 00:57:43,686
risk like And that if you

1218
00:57:43,299 --> 00:57:45,897
you do thinking that for You

1219
00:57:45,636 --> 00:57:49,640
yourself stop work you let AI do the

1220
00:57:50,000 --> 00:57:55,596
But if you that thinking think

1221
00:57:54,798 --> 00:57:59,499
happens space in an external and

1222
00:57:59,499 --> 00:58:04,612
you keep want the to critical

1223
00:58:04,612 --> 00:58:07,936
approach you're to the information dealing

1224
00:58:07,936 --> 00:58:10,432
with the if experience you want

1225
00:58:10,432 --> 00:58:14,398
to enriched keep makes thinking that

1226
00:58:14,400 --> 00:58:19,896
uh any interesting output for other

1227
00:58:19,200 --> 00:58:23,036
want humans to develop if you

1228
00:58:23,040 --> 00:58:26,913
skills your own your thinking own

1229
00:58:26,913 --> 00:58:32,720
thinking Then abilities it becomes all

1230
00:58:31,760 --> 00:58:36,140
the creation about of an that

1231
00:58:34,960 --> 00:58:39,688
environment is but also personal external

1232
00:58:39,688 --> 00:58:43,198
because external only in space an

1233
00:58:43,200 --> 00:58:45,877
complexity you can build You can

1234
00:58:45,877 --> 00:58:48,553
combine up few more than a

1235
00:58:48,559 --> 00:58:53,959
Um things so AI makes it

1236
00:58:53,959 --> 00:58:56,904
in that my we opinion need

1237
00:58:56,904 --> 00:59:02,000
to obvious create external thinking personal

1238
00:59:02,000 --> 00:59:06,960
Even spaces more than shift that

1239
00:59:06,960 --> 00:59:11,920
I the hope discussion that we

1240
00:59:11,920 --> 00:59:17,680
the um the more question towards

1241
00:59:16,269 --> 00:59:20,617
of how common can spaces we

1242
00:59:20,617 --> 00:59:25,625
curate to think a together third

1243
00:59:24,614 --> 00:59:30,320
in like place information between out

1244
00:59:29,393 --> 00:59:35,759
the there big um that quickly

1245
00:59:33,440 --> 00:59:39,046
can be presented searched by AI

1246
00:59:38,745 --> 00:59:42,571
and and our minds own little

1247
00:59:42,048 --> 00:59:45,664
uh tiny that think have to

1248
00:59:44,786 --> 00:59:49,304
these deal third with that spaces

1249
00:59:48,376 --> 00:59:50,840
I we will make be the

1250
00:59:50,810 --> 00:59:53,440
where dis How we we curate

1251
00:59:53,024 --> 00:59:55,844
build them how them will how

1252
00:59:55,415 --> 00:59:59,369
be we the think space about

1253
00:59:59,156 --> 01:00:01,961
will them on be how the

1254
01:00:01,615 --> 01:00:04,687
we question deal with other AR

1255
01:00:04,687 --> 01:00:08,622
like kind with of every information

1256
01:00:07,760 --> 01:00:10,672
face at overload the moment um

1257
01:00:10,672 --> 01:00:13,330
we well And will the it

1258
01:00:12,920 --> 01:00:17,274
question replace will our thinking or

1259
01:00:16,693 --> 01:00:21,806
it um increase um our It

1260
01:00:21,806 --> 01:00:25,657
really ability depends on how third

1261
01:00:24,964 --> 01:00:28,402
we build spaces these That that's

1262
01:00:27,599 --> 01:00:30,598
view my point of

1263
01:00:31,359 --> 01:00:36,455
Perhaps a a a way of AI viewing

1264
01:00:35,752 --> 01:00:38,153
itself it kind is of that

1265
01:00:37,640 --> 01:00:39,524
streamlines you know we research can

1266
01:00:39,524 --> 01:00:41,572
ask it want any Uh questions

1267
01:00:40,888 --> 01:00:42,664
we can we do inquiry a

1268
01:00:42,664 --> 01:00:45,031
deep and research then have current

1269
01:00:44,185 --> 01:00:47,440
all of information the the subject

1270
01:00:46,577 --> 01:00:50,320
on a subject specific 100 Whether

1271
01:00:49,248 --> 01:00:52,288
accurate or it not kind of

1272
01:00:51,760 --> 01:00:54,720
it's varies will never but AI

1273
01:00:54,130 --> 01:00:56,816
replace thought deep Now personal we

1274
01:00:56,816 --> 01:00:58,912
can external use reference it as

1275
01:00:58,912 --> 01:01:01,384
an to off bounce But more

1276
01:01:00,776 --> 01:01:03,520
our ideas often that than you

1277
01:01:03,329 --> 01:01:05,856
not phrase the way your it's

1278
01:01:05,440 --> 01:01:08,736
question going to to an intuitit

1279
01:01:08,000 --> 01:01:11,568
AI thinking your underlying your underlying

1280
01:01:11,040 --> 01:01:14,344
underlying reasoning perspective the And of

1281
01:01:14,016 --> 01:01:16,000
that's what you now want why

1282
01:01:15,760 --> 01:01:18,028
where we have we situations have

1283
01:01:18,028 --> 01:01:21,430
people delusional who are fantasies going

1284
01:01:21,430 --> 01:01:24,237
into because believes their it's AI

1285
01:01:24,008 --> 01:01:26,670
God worshipper and they are And

1286
01:01:26,670 --> 01:01:29,385
open its AI to itself employ

1287
01:01:29,099 --> 01:01:33,079
has now had psychologists psychotherapists to

1288
01:01:32,762 --> 01:01:35,839
uh try why to is understand

1289
01:01:34,602 --> 01:01:37,888
this happening that if because you

1290
01:01:37,888 --> 01:01:41,671
have it a seems certain emotional

1291
01:01:40,621 --> 01:01:43,501
level or of a of kind

1292
01:01:43,359 --> 01:01:46,959
sorts of a mental disorder health

1293
01:01:45,942 --> 01:01:49,323
of be issue subject that to

1294
01:01:48,759 --> 01:01:51,396
you what could AI that uh

1295
01:01:51,206 --> 01:01:54,441
AI the itself delusions can go

1296
01:01:54,160 --> 01:01:56,720
can't down and place so deep

1297
01:01:56,382 --> 01:01:58,538
if personal it is thought more

1298
01:01:58,538 --> 01:02:00,254
or that less kind of

1299
01:01:59,280 --> 01:02:01,824
thinking skills critical So question I

1300
01:02:01,824 --> 01:02:04,019
think to the ask next is

1301
01:02:03,520 --> 01:02:06,592
critical well thinking why are skills

1302
01:02:05,760 --> 01:02:08,640
we're important in an era if

1303
01:02:08,156 --> 01:02:10,072
with AI answer that all can

1304
01:02:09,840 --> 01:02:11,491
of just our of questions our

1305
01:02:11,491 --> 01:02:13,356
thinking and do And all I

1306
01:02:13,040 --> 01:02:15,221
default think to my now I

1307
01:02:15,149 --> 01:02:17,257
this would idea engineering of of

1308
01:02:17,257 --> 01:02:19,615
prompt or it's referred more to

1309
01:02:19,359 --> 01:02:21,831
recently now as been context because

1310
01:02:21,343 --> 01:02:23,948
engineering there's trying a lot to

1311
01:02:23,572 --> 01:02:25,502
more figure than just out best

1312
01:02:25,256 --> 01:02:27,436
how prompt you create because the

1313
01:02:27,440 --> 01:02:29,856
agents now that we are have

1314
01:02:29,388 --> 01:02:32,797
doing AI complex and you workflows

1315
01:02:31,352 --> 01:02:33,968
really have to about be able

1316
01:02:33,773 --> 01:02:36,208
how to is think this workflow

1317
01:02:35,280 --> 01:02:37,669
work and going if you're to

1318
01:02:37,669 --> 01:02:39,984
to employed especially at a now

1319
01:02:39,861 --> 01:02:42,264
job millennials and especially or Gen

1320
01:02:42,151 --> 01:02:44,691
the Z's Gen having Z generation

1321
01:02:43,621 --> 01:02:45,872
a very tough are college time

1322
01:02:45,872 --> 01:02:48,196
graduating and getting from a the

1323
01:02:47,999 --> 01:02:50,260
job low because level all jobs

1324
01:02:49,919 --> 01:02:52,324
of are able now to easily

1325
01:02:51,344 --> 01:02:54,178
being taken being over you by

1326
01:02:53,999 --> 01:02:56,559
have AI the But if ability

1327
01:02:55,599 --> 01:02:59,238
engineering to do to context think

1328
01:02:59,119 --> 01:03:01,679
I about make AI why work

1329
01:03:01,057 --> 01:03:03,250
is how best do in if

1330
01:03:02,959 --> 01:03:04,879
this you use have uh case

1331
01:03:04,360 --> 01:03:06,953
trauma or or mental issues health

1332
01:03:06,400 --> 01:03:08,340
and you're GPT as wanting a

1333
01:03:08,340 --> 01:03:10,298
therapist to use Chad how my

1334
01:03:10,180 --> 01:03:12,480
do conversation I best in phrase

1335
01:03:11,810 --> 01:03:13,774
a way going where it's to

1336
01:03:13,700 --> 01:03:15,498
not lead fantasy me down a

1337
01:03:15,119 --> 01:03:17,719
Because delusional it's how AI you

1338
01:03:17,250 --> 01:03:19,505
And I'm talk sure to we've

1339
01:03:18,759 --> 01:03:20,858
an way all where used AI

1340
01:03:20,784 --> 01:03:22,287
you in ask a gives it

1341
01:03:22,287 --> 01:03:24,794
something you a response and it

1342
01:03:24,592 --> 01:03:26,504
but then then you you realize

1343
01:03:26,008 --> 01:03:28,209
but this wait it additional doesn't

1344
01:03:28,209 --> 01:03:30,795
have context something It's or missing

1345
01:03:30,176 --> 01:03:32,096
I don't quite feel right like

1346
01:03:32,096 --> 01:03:33,350
it's And and then you you

1347
01:03:33,188 --> 01:03:34,655
respond say oh to it what

1348
01:03:34,559 --> 01:03:36,396
then about it's this like And

1349
01:03:36,149 --> 01:03:38,512
oh brilliant yes sir you This

1350
01:03:38,269 --> 01:03:40,020
are is changes and it its

1351
01:03:40,020 --> 01:03:42,266
answer completely And so I of

1352
01:03:42,055 --> 01:03:44,611
think this comes all saying back

1353
01:03:44,428 --> 01:03:46,369
is down a to encompass what

1354
01:03:46,369 --> 01:03:48,940
I'm help is us that in

1355
01:03:48,447 --> 01:03:51,580
AI our can accomplishing our journey

1356
01:03:51,580 --> 01:03:53,951
for for thinking building but for

1357
01:03:53,896 --> 01:03:56,991
I for think even like everything

1358
01:03:55,552 --> 01:03:57,967
it's a tool else just and

1359
01:03:57,760 --> 01:03:59,919
start the moment to see you

1360
01:03:59,737 --> 01:04:02,720
AI going as something to replace

1361
01:04:02,208 --> 01:04:04,745
that is your for need writing

1362
01:04:03,840 --> 01:04:07,320
for thinking for creative you're thought

1363
01:04:06,335 --> 01:04:08,371
going down then a that dark

1364
01:04:08,095 --> 01:04:09,375
could path just because lead to

1365
01:04:09,375 --> 01:04:12,680
a fantasy delusional where you're just

1366
01:04:12,559 --> 01:04:14,479
anything kind of new not and

1367
01:04:14,048 --> 01:04:16,879
creating who knows might end where

1368
01:04:16,355 --> 01:04:18,680
up So that I ever think

1369
01:04:17,846 --> 01:04:20,769
we need now to more emphasize

1370
01:04:19,610 --> 01:04:22,759
than of critical the importance thinking

1371
01:04:22,720 --> 01:04:24,820
you're because going that is to

1372
01:04:24,820 --> 01:04:26,500
leverage how to AI get to

1373
01:04:26,266 --> 01:04:28,331
a allow job to you allow

1374
01:04:27,760 --> 01:04:30,396
of everybody you to get ahead

1375
01:04:29,712 --> 01:04:31,864
else who leverage is not the

1376
01:04:31,664 --> 01:04:34,304
able ability to and to think

1377
01:04:33,405 --> 01:04:37,395
then apply properly So that that's

1378
01:04:36,466 --> 01:04:39,510
to AI that's I I my

1379
01:04:39,392 --> 01:04:42,874
totally my two agree cents that

1380
01:04:42,330 --> 01:04:46,359
Yeah the is way we is

1381
01:04:44,962 --> 01:04:53,119
use it crucial there and is a that

1382
01:04:51,705 --> 01:04:54,135
way to use that it like

1383
01:04:53,661 --> 01:04:56,767
replaces a machine your thinking bicycle

1384
01:04:56,371 --> 01:04:58,622
like you like drive a of

1385
01:04:58,519 --> 01:05:01,439
to walking work with So instead

1386
01:05:00,488 --> 01:05:03,046
you can don't just roll have

1387
01:05:02,976 --> 01:05:04,975
and to put But any you

1388
01:05:04,651 --> 01:05:07,039
effort can use into it the

1389
01:05:06,799 --> 01:05:10,479
increase bicycle as your well range to

1390
01:05:10,480 --> 01:05:15,714
places to or discover to train

1391
01:05:14,618 --> 01:05:19,203
new to your enhance muscles and

1392
01:05:18,509 --> 01:05:22,389
what um you certainly have Um

1393
01:05:21,715 --> 01:05:24,949
it's about so how so there

1394
01:05:23,895 --> 01:05:26,075
to use will it be Um

1395
01:05:26,009 --> 01:05:32,023
certainly curated environments um as you

1396
01:05:31,839 --> 01:05:36,128
Some describe them that fit for

1397
01:05:36,128 --> 01:05:42,736
mental are health some that counseling

1398
01:05:40,506 --> 01:05:45,219
are fit for and um pushing

1399
01:05:44,558 --> 01:05:48,399
research research and You know change

1400
01:05:48,296 --> 01:05:50,399
that your way to of thinking

1401
01:05:49,839 --> 01:05:52,895
world about requires the more information

1402
01:05:51,639 --> 01:05:53,759
than one piece But of you

1403
01:05:53,440 --> 01:05:55,487
of need to pieces take a

1404
01:05:55,487 --> 01:05:58,617
lot of You information need some

1405
01:05:58,617 --> 01:06:02,213
kind into of account some form

1406
01:06:01,359 --> 01:06:07,277
complexity of Um it's not mind

1407
01:06:07,277 --> 01:06:11,337
blowing my worldview It's not changed

1408
01:06:10,474 --> 01:06:13,401
oh wow in an more instant

1409
01:06:13,401 --> 01:06:17,116
It's that mundane probably that is

1410
01:06:17,116 --> 01:06:22,746
the we kind of buffer need

1411
01:06:20,319 --> 01:06:25,079
um deal with the to information

1412
01:06:25,079 --> 01:06:27,676
coming When I say in critical

1413
01:06:27,119 --> 01:06:29,114
it's like thinking uh the I

1414
01:06:29,039 --> 01:06:31,439
the suppose ability pause to stop

1415
01:06:31,439 --> 01:06:34,885
and and a particular question thought

1416
01:06:34,000 --> 01:06:37,355
just accepting right Instead what of

1417
01:06:36,880 --> 01:06:40,199
external says or information what somebody

1418
01:06:39,760 --> 01:06:42,224
says else about or something that

1419
01:06:42,224 --> 01:06:44,688
And we default we to tend

1420
01:06:44,585 --> 01:06:47,413
uh now just to asking everything

1421
01:06:46,646 --> 01:06:48,904
AI for and outright then just

1422
01:06:48,657 --> 01:06:51,270
what accepting it says without about

1423
01:06:51,098 --> 01:06:53,880
thinking what it's accepting actually saying

1424
01:06:53,279 --> 01:06:55,279
that information just know if And

1425
01:06:54,929 --> 01:06:56,761
we're you in accepting a world

1426
01:06:56,711 --> 01:06:58,428
information we're just might from an

1427
01:06:58,288 --> 01:06:59,504
not AI always it been be

1428
01:06:59,504 --> 01:07:01,808
correct shown And it's it's definitely correct

1429
01:07:01,808 --> 01:07:03,612
Um not always and so like

1430
01:07:03,440 --> 01:07:05,616
that wrong can lead paths us

1431
01:07:05,584 --> 01:07:08,049
But down I perspective I suppose

1432
01:07:07,774 --> 01:07:11,119
of a utilizing a to zetocasten

1433
01:07:09,926 --> 01:07:12,543
AI in relation is that can

1434
01:07:12,159 --> 01:07:14,239
perhaps be good it's for it

1435
01:07:13,935 --> 01:07:16,719
summarizing know I I I assume don't

1436
01:07:16,720 --> 01:07:18,901
implemented that Obsidian any hasn't AI

1437
01:07:18,901 --> 01:07:21,394
functionality assume if they but did

1438
01:07:21,082 --> 01:07:23,022
I it because would it's be

1439
01:07:22,840 --> 01:07:25,040
like helpful everything you can else

1440
01:07:24,941 --> 01:07:27,097
build where Google out say uh

1441
01:07:27,097 --> 01:07:28,666
forgot like like the the the

1442
01:07:28,666 --> 01:07:31,110
Google I'm forgetting podcast where the

1443
01:07:31,110 --> 01:07:33,162
the you name can of upload

1444
01:07:32,496 --> 01:07:35,597
that and PDFs then of information

1445
01:07:34,186 --> 01:07:38,254
generate a kind podcast of summarize

1446
01:07:37,251 --> 01:07:39,701
that will the what information you've

1447
01:07:39,701 --> 01:07:41,329
up told in it of to

1448
01:07:41,329 --> 01:07:42,957
to perhaps specify I think So

1449
01:07:42,960 --> 01:07:45,294
in there utilizing could be a

1450
01:07:45,228 --> 01:07:47,496
AI benefit for still that But

1451
01:07:47,381 --> 01:07:51,054
is overall that it there's overrelyant

1452
01:07:50,142 --> 01:07:53,593
a risk on of AI being

1453
01:07:52,290 --> 01:07:55,998
as a means externalizing of of

1454
01:07:55,711 --> 01:07:58,870
your it's thinking still because today

1455
01:07:58,351 --> 01:08:01,496
we just years as prevalent after

1456
01:08:01,496 --> 01:08:04,216
it many became ability popular to

1457
01:08:04,216 --> 01:08:06,745
create that the a directly a

1458
01:08:06,745 --> 01:08:09,738
good proportional prompt is to the

1459
01:08:09,583 --> 01:08:12,486
the response quality you're of going

1460
01:08:11,920 --> 01:08:14,318
you have to get a And zettocast if

1461
01:08:14,319 --> 01:08:18,288
system where you a are these able

1462
01:08:15,059 --> 01:08:17,152
and network or

1463
01:08:18,288 --> 01:08:20,556
to ideas see all and of

1464
01:08:20,399 --> 01:08:23,636
thoughts the interconnectedness and intercon to

1465
01:08:23,570 --> 01:08:25,184
of give them you is a

1466
01:08:25,073 --> 01:08:27,733
going different you ask perspective that

1467
01:08:27,733 --> 01:08:30,107
question when going to AI to

1468
01:08:29,937 --> 01:08:31,851
that generate is a much a

1469
01:08:31,551 --> 01:08:34,602
better proportionally response than had a

1470
01:08:34,108 --> 01:08:36,152
if system you had in not

1471
01:08:36,106 --> 01:08:38,111
which see all you of were

1472
01:08:37,791 --> 01:08:41,006
the able connectedness to various thoughts

1473
01:08:40,511 --> 01:08:43,362
between and ideas critical the idea

1474
01:08:43,199 --> 01:08:47,839
thinking of reflecting as stopping and

1475
01:08:47,199 --> 01:08:52,106
at taking something the time And

1476
01:08:51,839 --> 01:08:57,013
to it look is something connected

1477
01:08:55,606 --> 01:08:59,536
that is often to overlooked reflection

1478
01:08:59,536 --> 01:09:02,096
is Um not information just about

1479
01:09:02,096 --> 01:09:05,759
judging coming challenging in It's also

1480
01:09:05,476 --> 01:09:08,398
the about way we and to

1481
01:09:07,831 --> 01:09:11,756
look change at the and world

1482
01:09:10,316 --> 01:09:14,463
develop mature way of in looking

1483
01:09:13,513 --> 01:09:17,167
our it at with the experience world

1484
01:09:17,167 --> 01:09:21,287
and enrich So being realize able

1485
01:09:20,621 --> 01:09:24,176
that to the prompt probably you

1486
01:09:23,662 --> 01:09:26,109
not use the is best you

1487
01:09:26,035 --> 01:09:28,408
one have to um add but

1488
01:09:27,636 --> 01:09:30,181
context that to it better to

1489
01:09:30,181 --> 01:09:35,159
get a Um is response only

1490
01:09:35,159 --> 01:09:40,357
possible something if on side your

1491
01:09:40,152 --> 01:09:44,713
has side developed on the personal

1492
01:09:44,280 --> 01:09:47,376
over we time look too Um

1493
01:09:47,095 --> 01:09:52,639
much maybe at judging coming information

1494
01:09:51,270 --> 01:09:55,262
in and developing too little our

1495
01:09:55,262 --> 01:09:58,538
ability about to deal information with

1496
01:09:58,538 --> 01:10:04,847
the Um so not just about not

1497
01:10:04,847 --> 01:10:09,584
trusting um what's being coming worried

1498
01:10:08,495 --> 01:10:11,629
in but that also oneself maybe

1499
01:10:11,432 --> 01:10:14,246
needs a little um handle bit

1500
01:10:14,246 --> 01:10:17,517
more development uh the information to

1501
01:10:17,520 --> 01:10:20,256
being open to have and your

1502
01:10:20,256 --> 01:10:23,316
mind it changed by Yeah And

1503
01:10:23,316 --> 01:10:26,625
in an area in in in

1504
01:10:26,406 --> 01:10:28,556
in an area which in which

1505
01:10:28,260 --> 01:10:30,240
we AI daily is a lives

1506
01:10:29,714 --> 01:10:31,306
part of I our think more

1507
01:10:31,260 --> 01:10:33,840
it's important now important than system

1508
01:10:33,011 --> 01:10:35,600
ever to where have a information you're

1509
01:10:35,600 --> 01:10:38,223
able to because collect in that

1510
01:10:37,890 --> 01:10:40,011
helping will be set useful you

1511
01:10:40,011 --> 01:10:42,764
apart else from who's everybody able

1512
01:10:42,764 --> 01:10:44,768
to using use this it in

1513
01:10:44,417 --> 01:10:45,944
tool a but much without more

1514
01:10:45,944 --> 01:10:48,290
generic the level capacity of might

1515
01:10:47,920 --> 01:10:50,462
insights otherwise that you gain maintain

1516
01:10:49,831 --> 01:10:51,756
by being your own able to

1517
01:10:51,404 --> 01:10:53,832
personal system note I taking think

1518
01:10:53,760 --> 01:10:55,904
like we've Ryan seen Holidayiday people

1519
01:10:55,904 --> 01:10:58,210
like Thiago David Forte Pell all

1520
01:10:58,210 --> 01:11:00,478
very in prominent the self figures

1521
01:11:00,032 --> 01:11:03,639
help developed space who've a variety

1522
01:11:02,752 --> 01:11:05,744
either of based books on or

1523
01:11:05,301 --> 01:11:08,096
the systems Zenoccasten think system it

1524
01:11:08,096 --> 01:11:10,256
it's So something I people that

1525
01:11:10,059 --> 01:11:12,096
who it have as have they've

1526
01:11:11,349 --> 01:11:13,560
used it cited they to you

1527
01:11:13,170 --> 01:11:15,822
think know it more helps clearly

1528
01:11:15,512 --> 01:11:17,943
them It idea helps retention with

1529
01:11:17,792 --> 01:11:19,652
uh uh and just you're get

1530
01:11:19,584 --> 01:11:21,997
able overall to insights kind of

1531
01:11:21,527 --> 01:11:24,143
from more uh areas creative of

1532
01:11:23,760 --> 01:11:26,236
you work might in not which

1533
01:11:25,504 --> 01:11:27,248
be able gain to these to

1534
01:11:27,248 --> 01:11:29,320
create insights or if such a

1535
01:11:28,975 --> 01:11:30,799
you system had not So had

1536
01:11:30,460 --> 01:11:33,120
I that think everybody it's something

1537
01:11:32,777 --> 01:11:35,451
whether consultant you're or a a

1538
01:11:35,247 --> 01:11:38,249
business writer everybody or a student

1539
01:11:37,504 --> 01:11:40,033
should uh really um to consider

1540
01:11:39,583 --> 01:11:42,175
to some having extent going because

1541
01:11:41,653 --> 01:11:43,528
to be that's one of will

1542
01:11:43,197 --> 01:11:44,992
the help small set things you

1543
01:11:44,992 --> 01:11:48,137
apart world going in into which

1544
01:11:45,129 --> 01:11:45,515
that

1545
01:11:47,432 --> 01:11:51,276
a everywhere AI is just prevalent

1546
01:11:51,280 --> 01:11:54,236
Yeah we I think go the

1547
01:11:53,920 --> 01:11:56,601
you question distinguish of yourself how

1548
01:11:56,601 --> 01:12:01,519
can if um everyone can access

1549
01:11:59,120 --> 01:12:03,528
the the huge pool of there information

1550
01:12:03,528 --> 01:12:08,406
out certainly calls Um for a

1551
01:12:08,320 --> 01:12:12,299
thinking curated space personal Yeah there you're

1552
01:12:12,299 --> 01:12:15,970
right And so I I I know a

1553
01:12:15,798 --> 01:12:17,763
that new you're book and working

1554
01:12:17,080 --> 01:12:19,302
I think on scale you started

1555
01:12:18,941 --> 01:12:20,505
back to and coaching kind of

1556
01:12:20,464 --> 01:12:22,399
wondering individual if kind you of

1557
01:12:22,399 --> 01:12:23,995
insight can offer into your any

1558
01:12:23,839 --> 01:12:27,001
your project next Um it's still

1559
01:12:27,001 --> 01:12:29,624
in in kind development of pick

1560
01:12:29,624 --> 01:12:32,480
up Uh on I my which

1561
01:12:31,328 --> 01:12:34,880
academic work is um a epistemology little

1562
01:12:34,880 --> 01:12:39,752
bit more but about I contribution

1563
01:12:37,555 --> 01:12:41,400
hope to make to a what

1564
01:12:40,719 --> 01:12:45,520
an almost epistemic seems crisis like

1565
01:12:45,519 --> 01:12:48,457
at dealing the with moment um

1566
01:12:48,457 --> 01:12:51,866
a um lot and of disinformation how

1567
01:12:51,866 --> 01:12:57,408
to be um able to deal

1568
01:12:57,408 --> 01:13:04,192
with that or um set yourself problematic up

1569
01:13:04,192 --> 01:13:09,088
to uh information um environment it

1570
01:13:08,957 --> 01:13:11,392
And will I have think a

1571
01:13:11,199 --> 01:13:14,464
these lot to kinds do with

1572
01:13:14,105 --> 01:13:18,208
of curating shared think spaces about

1573
01:13:17,737 --> 01:13:23,120
and shared how to thinking Um

1574
01:13:20,416 --> 01:13:25,666
spaces yeah I contribution would like

1575
01:13:25,666 --> 01:13:28,664
to um make to a that

1576
01:13:28,159 --> 01:13:31,099
it might solution take a little

1577
01:13:30,512 --> 01:13:33,103
Um bit but more time And

1578
01:13:33,103 --> 01:13:36,139
and I I can only kind

1579
01:13:36,139 --> 01:13:38,439
of hope notetaking that teaching as

1580
01:13:38,439 --> 01:13:40,201
like as a a score core

1581
01:13:40,201 --> 01:13:42,660
skill as a alongside math could

1582
01:13:42,660 --> 01:13:45,402
hopefully writing and become future and

1583
01:13:45,096 --> 01:13:47,059
part education of our dream I

1584
01:13:47,059 --> 01:13:48,922
can we because can only I

1585
01:13:48,719 --> 01:13:51,251
massively think that for would our

1586
01:13:51,251 --> 01:13:53,276
ability help reflect to to to

1587
01:13:53,200 --> 01:13:55,433
question think um to and a

1588
01:13:55,120 --> 01:13:58,598
especially world in in just which

1589
01:13:57,751 --> 01:14:00,596
a little you know an chat

1590
01:14:00,497 --> 01:14:04,153
answer conversation is yeah away um

1591
01:14:04,159 --> 01:14:07,568
so I think that's to it's

1592
01:14:07,104 --> 01:14:09,029
end a um good wondering good

1593
01:14:09,029 --> 01:14:11,960
spot kind if of you practical

1594
01:14:10,912 --> 01:14:13,838
have any advice listening for that

1595
01:14:13,424 --> 01:14:15,744
anybody that perhaps conversation this has

1596
01:14:15,679 --> 01:14:17,919
the piqu their zero interest caston

1597
01:14:17,424 --> 01:14:20,159
in go system uh to where

1598
01:14:19,482 --> 01:14:22,353
kind of they learn might more

1599
01:14:21,840 --> 01:14:24,076
Well what about I offer this

1600
01:14:24,080 --> 01:14:28,560
techsmartnotes you can find on Um but there com

1601
01:14:28,493 --> 01:14:30,973
is especially a lot out the

1602
01:14:30,973 --> 01:14:34,593
Obsidian there community lively and is

1603
01:14:34,265 --> 01:14:37,919
helpful so supportive and friendly I

1604
01:14:37,642 --> 01:14:41,840

a um lot of support and

1606
01:14:44,480 --> 01:14:49,424
there I wouldn't Um the underestimate power

1607
01:14:49,424 --> 01:14:54,800
of the metaphor thinking of external

1608
01:14:53,460 --> 01:14:57,809
Just thinking about differently thinking makes

1609
01:14:56,880 --> 01:15:00,316
in my a huge opinion difference

1610
01:15:00,077 --> 01:15:04,305
um notetaking taking more seriously and

1611
01:15:04,305 --> 01:15:08,289
what it your can uh do

1612
01:15:07,583 --> 01:15:12,008
ideas to support and thought and

1613
01:15:12,008 --> 01:15:17,191
not development just thinking about something

1614
01:15:16,376 --> 01:15:19,175
thinking that as goes on just

1615
01:15:19,175 --> 01:15:21,839
as in a your metaphor brain

1616
01:15:21,636 --> 01:15:24,097
I can think be extremely it's

1617
01:15:24,097 --> 01:15:28,059
