1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,120
It's been a while since I've done a

2
00:00:02,320 --> 00:00:07,839
cooking kit video where I've introduced

3
00:00:05,120 --> 00:00:09,200
a new cooking kit. Now, I have a couple

4
00:00:07,839 --> 00:00:12,639
different cooking kits that I'm going to

5
00:00:09,200 --> 00:00:16,160
introduce you today. One of actually,

6
00:00:12,639 --> 00:00:18,800
come to think of it, all three of these

7
00:00:16,160 --> 00:00:21,279
cooking kits were gifts to me at one

8
00:00:18,800 --> 00:00:23,119
point or another. Some were given to me

9
00:00:21,279 --> 00:00:25,600
a long time ago, even before I made the

10
00:00:23,119 --> 00:00:27,920
channel. Uh, some were given to me while

11
00:00:25,600 --> 00:00:30,000
I was making the channel. But the focus

12
00:00:27,920 --> 00:00:32,640
of today is kind of take you through a

13
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:35,120
history and an idea of what kind of

14
00:00:32,640 --> 00:00:36,800
fuels and cooking kits to choose, give

15
00:00:35,120 --> 00:00:38,480
show you some of the interesting ones

16
00:00:36,800 --> 00:00:40,480
that I have that have been used by

17
00:00:38,480 --> 00:00:43,120
campers and avid outdoors people for a

18
00:00:40,480 --> 00:00:45,600
long time and uh so you can make your

19
00:00:43,120 --> 00:00:47,600
your best judgment. Now, I think I'm

20
00:00:45,600 --> 00:00:49,680
going to start off probably with this

21
00:00:47,600 --> 00:00:51,680
one here. This is the very first cooking

22
00:00:49,680 --> 00:00:53,440
kit video that I ever made on the

23
00:00:51,680 --> 00:00:56,559
channel, and this is from the late

24
00:00:53,440 --> 00:00:58,719
1800s. Now, this cooking kit, it's

25
00:00:56,559 --> 00:01:02,480
probably uh made out of copper and then

26
00:00:58,719 --> 00:01:06,080
it's been tinned. It has a fuel canister

27
00:01:02,480 --> 00:01:08,320
like so. Now, I don't know if they

28
00:01:06,080 --> 00:01:11,680
actually used the fuel canister itself

29
00:01:08,320 --> 00:01:13,760
for the stove. I think it works better

30
00:01:11,680 --> 00:01:15,840
because originally it came with just

31
00:01:13,760 --> 00:01:18,320
this little alcohol burner, which does

32
00:01:15,840 --> 00:01:20,320
all right. It's it's okay, but it takes

33
00:01:18,320 --> 00:01:21,840
forever for it to cook. And really, all

34
00:01:20,320 --> 00:01:24,479
it does is just get things up to a

35
00:01:21,840 --> 00:01:26,560
simmer. um if you wait long enough it

36
00:01:24,479 --> 00:01:29,759
can get it up to a boil, but it takes a

37
00:01:26,560 --> 00:01:33,040
long time to get there. But whereas

38
00:01:29,759 --> 00:01:35,520
using this and I fabricated a wick like

39
00:01:33,040 --> 00:01:38,240
so, uh it works a little bit better than

40
00:01:35,520 --> 00:01:40,159
just using this little one. But anyhow,

41
00:01:38,240 --> 00:01:41,759
you got your

42
00:01:40,159 --> 00:01:44,640
burner one way or the other, the

43
00:01:41,759 --> 00:01:46,799
canister or this thing, and you put your

44
00:01:44,640 --> 00:01:50,000
water, your soup, or what have you in

45
00:01:46,799 --> 00:01:52,640
that, and then you're good to go. That's

46
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:55,520
that's it. So, it's a oneman for sure

47
00:01:52,640 --> 00:01:57,520
cooking kit. Now, all these things can

48
00:01:55,520 --> 00:02:01,920
just fit inside. Makes it rather

49
00:01:57,520 --> 00:02:05,520
portable. Perfect for a late 19th

50
00:02:01,920 --> 00:02:07,600
century outdoors person. As you can see,

51
00:02:05,520 --> 00:02:09,599
it's got the windcreen. It's got places

52
00:02:07,600 --> 00:02:10,879
for you to uh, of course, look in it,

53
00:02:09,599 --> 00:02:12,959
make sure that it's still burning

54
00:02:10,879 --> 00:02:15,440
because it is alcohol and you need dark

55
00:02:12,959 --> 00:02:17,440
to see whether or not it's burning. And

56
00:02:15,440 --> 00:02:19,680
you got this nice big port to light it.

57
00:02:17,440 --> 00:02:22,319
Okay, so that's pretty effective. The

58
00:02:19,680 --> 00:02:26,319
next one is the Theraos. Now, I love the

59
00:02:22,319 --> 00:02:28,319
Theraos. This is probably This is

60
00:02:26,319 --> 00:02:29,680
definitely my top two. It goes back and

61
00:02:28,319 --> 00:02:31,599
forth between the press and mess kit and

62
00:02:29,680 --> 00:02:34,400
this one cuz I think this one is

63
00:02:31,599 --> 00:02:37,280
ingenious. It really does work as

64
00:02:34,400 --> 00:02:40,000
advertised. The problem is the fuel

65
00:02:37,280 --> 00:02:43,440
doesn't exist anymore because I guess

66
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:45,040
they got a little bit of a a match with

67
00:02:43,440 --> 00:02:46,879
um Sterno, which is going to come up

68
00:02:45,040 --> 00:02:50,560
here in a little bit. But they came up

69
00:02:46,879 --> 00:02:53,280
with a an issue and they argued over

70
00:02:50,560 --> 00:02:55,440
patents and stuff. But here you have

71
00:02:53,280 --> 00:02:57,920
your cook kit. So you have one, two, and

72
00:02:55,440 --> 00:03:00,640
your skillet to cook on top of. You put

73
00:02:57,920 --> 00:03:02,800
your fuel, which was in this little cup.

74
00:03:00,640 --> 00:03:04,879
This is not the original cup. And it has

75
00:03:02,800 --> 00:03:06,879
a little canister that you put the fuel

76
00:03:04,879 --> 00:03:08,480
in on this has plenty of little

77
00:03:06,879 --> 00:03:12,640
perforations for the air flow to go

78
00:03:08,480 --> 00:03:15,840
through and heat rises. So as you cook

79
00:03:12,640 --> 00:03:17,920
the first one, heat is still rising up

80
00:03:15,840 --> 00:03:19,760
and it's heating up the second one and

81
00:03:17,920 --> 00:03:21,680
the third one. But the idea is that you

82
00:03:19,760 --> 00:03:24,560
put the thing that you want to eat first

83
00:03:21,680 --> 00:03:28,400
down below and as you get done cooking

84
00:03:24,560 --> 00:03:31,599
that you drop the next one,

85
00:03:28,400 --> 00:03:33,519
etc. So maybe you're getting your coffee

86
00:03:31,599 --> 00:03:36,640
in this one and your beans in this one.

87
00:03:33,519 --> 00:03:38,640
And then um maybe your eggs or bacon or

88
00:03:36,640 --> 00:03:40,640
something else on the skillet, right?

89
00:03:38,640 --> 00:03:42,560
But you want to drink your coffee. So

90
00:03:40,640 --> 00:03:44,080
you heat up your coffee first while it's

91
00:03:42,560 --> 00:03:46,640
cooling down, you have the next thing

92
00:03:44,080 --> 00:03:48,560
that's heating up. And by the time that

93
00:03:46,640 --> 00:03:51,200
that is done eating, that would be your

94
00:03:48,560 --> 00:03:53,120
main course, right? Then you have your

95
00:03:51,200 --> 00:03:54,640
secondary or vice versa, depending on

96
00:03:53,120 --> 00:03:58,480
what you're eating and in what order,

97
00:03:54,640 --> 00:04:03,680
you know? But I like how it all folds up

98
00:03:58,480 --> 00:04:06,000
together into one nice convenient

99
00:04:03,680 --> 00:04:07,519
package. One weird thing is this little

100
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:10,480
handle. I've shared that in a previous

101
00:04:07,519 --> 00:04:12,879
video. I'll put um I'll put a list of

102
00:04:10,480 --> 00:04:14,959
these videos in the description box. So

103
00:04:12,879 --> 00:04:17,359
if you want to see them in order or

104
00:04:14,959 --> 00:04:19,519
whatever, uh you can have take a look at

105
00:04:17,359 --> 00:04:21,519
it because I do go in a lot more detail

106
00:04:19,519 --> 00:04:24,560
even demonstrating their use in those

107
00:04:21,519 --> 00:04:26,320
videos. So, that is the Theros mess kit.

108
00:04:24,560 --> 00:04:29,360
Not to be confused with the Preston mess

109
00:04:26,320 --> 00:04:31,360
kit, which by the way, if you're uh not

110
00:04:29,360 --> 00:04:33,840
familiar with Preston mess kit, like I

111
00:04:31,360 --> 00:04:36,080
said, it's my top two, I go between the

112
00:04:33,840 --> 00:04:38,479
two, but it has your plate, has your

113
00:04:36,080 --> 00:04:40,880
skillet, has your cup, and has your

114
00:04:38,479 --> 00:04:42,479
canteen. It's all inclusive. And the

115
00:04:40,880 --> 00:04:44,240
cool thing is like the plate and the

116
00:04:42,479 --> 00:04:47,280
skillet can come together. It can create

117
00:04:44,240 --> 00:04:50,000
a baking vessel or a containing vessel

118
00:04:47,280 --> 00:04:51,919
for your viddles or what have you.

119
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:53,280
So, uh, if you want to, if you're

120
00:04:51,919 --> 00:04:55,199
interested and get on the list for that,

121
00:04:53,280 --> 00:04:57,199
in the description box below, there's a

122
00:04:55,199 --> 00:05:00,000
link there's a video to it. It shows you

123
00:04:57,199 --> 00:05:01,840
the history cuz the history is so cool.

124
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:03,520
But that is the Preston mess kit. And at

125
00:05:01,840 --> 00:05:05,520
the end of this video, I'll actually

126
00:05:03,520 --> 00:05:07,440
link it to that video because I'm trying

127
00:05:05,520 --> 00:05:09,199
to get 500 people interested. Once we

128
00:05:07,440 --> 00:05:10,800
get 500 people, we'll have the green

129
00:05:09,199 --> 00:05:12,960
light to go and we'll start putting this

130
00:05:10,800 --> 00:05:15,520
stuff into production and you can have

131
00:05:12,960 --> 00:05:17,520
your own. They're rare. They're rare as

132
00:05:15,520 --> 00:05:20,720
hens teeth. Even more rare than the

133
00:05:17,520 --> 00:05:23,360
theos. The theos is also super uncommon

134
00:05:20,720 --> 00:05:26,800
to find, but nonetheless, there you go.

135
00:05:23,360 --> 00:05:31,919
All right, so we've got those. We're not

136
00:05:26,800 --> 00:05:33,440
to the sterno yet. The next comes like

137
00:05:31,919 --> 00:05:36,639
kerosene.

138
00:05:33,440 --> 00:05:40,000
Like it, love it, hate it, whatever. The

139
00:05:36,639 --> 00:05:42,400
kerosene stove

140
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:46,000
works really well. And kerosene actually

141
00:05:42,400 --> 00:05:48,240
heats up hotter than what alcohol does.

142
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:49,919
So, um, it can be a little finicky to

143
00:05:48,240 --> 00:05:52,880
play with at first, especially like the

144
00:05:49,919 --> 00:05:55,759
older kerosene ones like this Primus,

145
00:05:52,880 --> 00:05:58,400
but once you get it dialed in, they work

146
00:05:55,759 --> 00:06:00,400
really well. I've got a larger one that

147
00:05:58,400 --> 00:06:02,960
I'm seriously thinking about selling

148
00:06:00,400 --> 00:06:04,639
because I can't get it to work and it's

149
00:06:02,960 --> 00:06:06,800
so big, it's way more than what I

150
00:06:04,639 --> 00:06:09,600
probably even need. So, uh, I got this

151
00:06:06,800 --> 00:06:12,240
little small one, the 96 versus the 100.

152
00:06:09,600 --> 00:06:14,319
And I like my 96. Smaller, lighter,

153
00:06:12,240 --> 00:06:17,440
easier to pack away, and it works.

154
00:06:14,319 --> 00:06:20,319
That's the best part is it works.

155
00:06:17,440 --> 00:06:23,680
But it uses uh kerosene, not alcohol.

156
00:06:20,319 --> 00:06:26,240
Sorry, meant to show you this when I was

157
00:06:23,680 --> 00:06:28,080
showing you the alcohol stove. A lot of

158
00:06:26,240 --> 00:06:30,560
people really like the alcohol stoves

159
00:06:28,080 --> 00:06:32,560
because you can get this like can make

160
00:06:30,560 --> 00:06:35,440
small rinky dink backpacking alcohol

161
00:06:32,560 --> 00:06:37,440
stoves and just using two pop cans if

162
00:06:35,440 --> 00:06:41,840
some scissors and you're good to go,

163
00:06:37,440 --> 00:06:44,560
right? Uh, so alcohol is still a very

164
00:06:41,840 --> 00:06:47,759
practical, modern source of cooking on

165
00:06:44,560 --> 00:06:49,520
the backpacking trails. You can get big

166
00:06:47,759 --> 00:06:51,440
gallons like this at your Lowe's or

167
00:06:49,520 --> 00:06:53,280
hardware store. That's where I got mine.

168
00:06:51,440 --> 00:06:55,520
Some people use heat because if you're

169
00:06:53,280 --> 00:06:57,600
overseas, I guess denatured alcohol is

170
00:06:55,520 --> 00:07:00,080
kind of hard to get for some reason. So,

171
00:06:57,600 --> 00:07:02,800
people use heat over there. I've never

172
00:07:00,080 --> 00:07:05,280
used heat. I've only used actual

173
00:07:02,800 --> 00:07:07,680
denatured alcohol. This is not the same

174
00:07:05,280 --> 00:07:09,919
alcohol that you use for like your first

175
00:07:07,680 --> 00:07:11,599
aid purposes and certainly not the same

176
00:07:09,919 --> 00:07:13,360
alcohol that you use to drink. So, don't

177
00:07:11,599 --> 00:07:16,160
drink this and don't use this for first

178
00:07:13,360 --> 00:07:20,400
aid. All right.

179
00:07:16,160 --> 00:07:23,840
All right. Now, we're getting to

180
00:07:20,400 --> 00:07:25,199
the stars of the show.

181
00:07:23,840 --> 00:07:26,639
Before I get to the stars of the show

182
00:07:25,199 --> 00:07:29,440
though, I'm going to jump ahead. I'm

183
00:07:26,639 --> 00:07:31,840
going to talk about the Optimus. Now, I

184
00:07:29,440 --> 00:07:34,160
like the Optimus stove. This thing is

185
00:07:31,840 --> 00:07:38,160
heavy for a backpacking stove, but it's

186
00:07:34,160 --> 00:07:41,120
all inclusive and it uses white gas. I

187
00:07:38,160 --> 00:07:43,919
like the Optimus more than I would like

188
00:07:41,120 --> 00:07:47,280
any of these other ones. When I go

189
00:07:43,919 --> 00:07:49,520
backpacking, when I go uh camp outs or

190
00:07:47,280 --> 00:07:52,000
whatever, I always take this with me. It

191
00:07:49,520 --> 00:07:53,280
is heavy compared to like modern

192
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:55,680
backpacking stoves, especially like

193
00:07:53,280 --> 00:08:00,160
Whisper Lights and stuff like that. But

194
00:07:55,680 --> 00:08:02,800
I like how simple it is. It has the

195
00:08:00,160 --> 00:08:04,400
priming pump that came with it. You can

196
00:08:02,800 --> 00:08:06,639
buy an extra one if you don't have one,

197
00:08:04,400 --> 00:08:08,479
but it comes with the priming pump. It

198
00:08:06,639 --> 00:08:10,400
works effectively. It's reliable. I

199
00:08:08,479 --> 00:08:12,400
don't need to take alcohol to prime it

200
00:08:10,400 --> 00:08:15,280
like I do with the kerosene stoves or

201
00:08:12,400 --> 00:08:19,199
other things. Um, white gas is getting

202
00:08:15,280 --> 00:08:20,639
harder to get in some places. I haven't

203
00:08:19,199 --> 00:08:22,800
had a trouble with it yet, but I seen

204
00:08:20,639 --> 00:08:25,759
that the prices are going up on white

205
00:08:22,800 --> 00:08:27,520
gas. Uh, I like my white gas camping

206
00:08:25,759 --> 00:08:31,039
stoves, you know, the old Coleman's. I

207
00:08:27,520 --> 00:08:32,959
also like my white gas lanterns. I know

208
00:08:31,039 --> 00:08:36,000
the government and companies are trying

209
00:08:32,959 --> 00:08:37,519
to phase those out in uh favor of things

210
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:39,279
that they could sell themselves. Like

211
00:08:37,519 --> 00:08:42,880
you got to buy those fuel canisters for

212
00:08:39,279 --> 00:08:44,720
the propane um anymore. So I like white

213
00:08:42,880 --> 00:08:48,640
gas.

214
00:08:44,720 --> 00:08:52,800
Now let's get to Sterno. I have two

215
00:08:48,640 --> 00:08:55,040
examples of Sterno Stows. Now these are

216
00:08:52,800 --> 00:08:57,360
the Sterno canisters, also known as

217
00:08:55,040 --> 00:09:00,399
shafing fuel. This is not the same

218
00:08:57,360 --> 00:09:03,440
recipe as they used to use back in the

219
00:09:00,399 --> 00:09:05,680
early 1900s when they first came out.

220
00:09:03,440 --> 00:09:07,760
Back in the early 1900s, Sterno

221
00:09:05,680 --> 00:09:10,000
exploded. There was a lot of people

222
00:09:07,760 --> 00:09:12,800
using Sterno as fuel. You've got like

223
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:14,560
the Theros company that was in arguments

224
00:09:12,800 --> 00:09:18,959
back and forth with them about using a

225
00:09:14,560 --> 00:09:23,120
similar fuel. But Sterno today does not

226
00:09:18,959 --> 00:09:25,440
heat up as hot as the old Sterno.

227
00:09:23,120 --> 00:09:27,440
Doesn't cook as well. Long story short,

228
00:09:25,440 --> 00:09:32,320
it does a good job of getting things up

229
00:09:27,440 --> 00:09:34,240
to maybe a a simmer or it can take a

230
00:09:32,320 --> 00:09:37,600
long time to get it bubbling and

231
00:09:34,240 --> 00:09:39,519
actually boiling. I have seen it in the

232
00:09:37,600 --> 00:09:41,920
right conditions, but in winter

233
00:09:39,519 --> 00:09:44,480
conditions, no. Sterno just doesn't work

234
00:09:41,920 --> 00:09:47,760
in winter conditions. Summer conditions,

235
00:09:44,480 --> 00:09:50,000
sure, like you can heat up some food uh

236
00:09:47,760 --> 00:09:52,240
and it does a pretty decent job, but not

237
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:54,800
in so much winter conditions. Now, what

238
00:09:52,240 --> 00:09:57,120
I have, this was given to me by one of

239
00:09:54,800 --> 00:09:59,680
my viewers and Facebook friends and

240
00:09:57,120 --> 00:10:01,600
everything. Warren, he had this and he

241
00:09:59,680 --> 00:10:04,480
asked me if I'd be interested in it. He

242
00:10:01,600 --> 00:10:07,600
sent it to me as uh, you know, just as

243
00:10:04,480 --> 00:10:10,000
my efforts trying to educate people

244
00:10:07,600 --> 00:10:11,839
about camping and the outdoors, and I

245
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:15,519
greatly appreciate it cuz I didn't know

246
00:10:11,839 --> 00:10:18,320
anything like this existed.

247
00:10:15,519 --> 00:10:21,200
So, as you can tell, Sterno fuel

248
00:10:18,320 --> 00:10:24,880
canisters used to be a fraction of the

249
00:10:21,200 --> 00:10:27,600
size. He sent me

250
00:10:24,880 --> 00:10:32,240
this can, too. So, I could cut it and it

251
00:10:27,600 --> 00:10:34,399
fits just right um to work on something

252
00:10:32,240 --> 00:10:35,920
like this. So, if I cut this out or

253
00:10:34,399 --> 00:10:39,519
maybe crimp it down or something like

254
00:10:35,920 --> 00:10:41,920
that, and I use this by putting the

255
00:10:39,519 --> 00:10:44,000
sterno inside of it and see how it

256
00:10:41,920 --> 00:10:46,399
works, which we will at a different

257
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:48,720
video, but this is just kind of a primer

258
00:10:46,399 --> 00:10:52,560
video showing you the history of various

259
00:10:48,720 --> 00:10:55,920
camping stoves that I have. So, anyhow,

260
00:10:52,560 --> 00:10:59,760
very small, very small canisters back in

261
00:10:55,920 --> 00:11:02,959
the day. And this would rest on that

262
00:10:59,760 --> 00:11:05,760
canister. And you would even have this

263
00:11:02,959 --> 00:11:08,160
handy dandy little paddle here to

264
00:11:05,760 --> 00:11:10,959
extinguish it, which is cool. Just like

265
00:11:08,160 --> 00:11:12,480
using the lid on your sterno cans today.

266
00:11:10,959 --> 00:11:13,680
So instead of blowing it out or

267
00:11:12,480 --> 00:11:15,839
something like that, you just put that

268
00:11:13,680 --> 00:11:18,720
out and it automatically extinguishes.

269
00:11:15,839 --> 00:11:21,680
Then you have this pot, which this pot

270
00:11:18,720 --> 00:11:25,839
is very reminiscent

271
00:11:21,680 --> 00:11:27,920
of this late 1800's one. As you can see,

272
00:11:25,839 --> 00:11:30,320
it's got the butterfly handles that are

273
00:11:27,920 --> 00:11:33,200
so prevalent in uh, you know,

274
00:11:30,320 --> 00:11:35,519
mid-century, early 20th century camping

275
00:11:33,200 --> 00:11:37,519
vessels. In fact,

276
00:11:35,519 --> 00:11:40,000
I even have this one, which is made out

277
00:11:37,519 --> 00:11:43,839
of 10. I don't know what stove or what

278
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:48,680
this went with, but same thing. Nice big

279
00:11:43,839 --> 00:11:48,680
size pretty much. Oops.

280
00:11:50,240 --> 00:11:55,519
Not quite. It's a little bit bigger.

281
00:11:53,920 --> 00:11:58,320
than the aluminum one. So, this is

282
00:11:55,519 --> 00:12:03,760
aluminum. They sold these up until the

283
00:11:58,320 --> 00:12:06,639
1950s, these Sterno things. Uh, but they

284
00:12:03,760 --> 00:12:08,880
were around as early as the 19 late

285
00:12:06,639 --> 00:12:11,200
1920s from different advertisements that

286
00:12:08,880 --> 00:12:13,920
I've seen. So, this is pretty cool. A

287
00:12:11,200 --> 00:12:15,600
nice little uh kit just to do what you

288
00:12:13,920 --> 00:12:17,519
need to do. Of course, if there was

289
00:12:15,600 --> 00:12:21,920
liquid in there, it' be more balanced.

290
00:12:17,519 --> 00:12:24,720
And you have this very thin aluminum

291
00:12:21,920 --> 00:12:26,480
lid. It doesn't sit on there very tight,

292
00:12:24,720 --> 00:12:29,040
but it'll still do the job that it needs

293
00:12:26,480 --> 00:12:30,639
to do to help things uh heat up a little

294
00:12:29,040 --> 00:12:35,720
bit faster.

295
00:12:30,639 --> 00:12:35,720
So, that is that old school

296
00:12:35,839 --> 00:12:39,920
Sterno stove. Everything packs into that

297
00:12:38,480 --> 00:12:42,399
pot, which is always handy when you're

298
00:12:39,920 --> 00:12:44,560
going backpacking. Next is this. This is

299
00:12:42,399 --> 00:12:46,079
probably like 1980s,

300
00:12:44,560 --> 00:12:50,240
1990s.

301
00:12:46,079 --> 00:12:53,040
This is also a Sterno stove. And if

302
00:12:50,240 --> 00:12:55,120
you've been around camping long enough,

303
00:12:53,040 --> 00:12:59,240
I pretty much guarantee

304
00:12:55,120 --> 00:12:59,240
you've seen these.

305
00:13:02,000 --> 00:13:05,360
Try to show it so you can see how it

306
00:13:03,600 --> 00:13:07,279
works. But you got a little wire here

307
00:13:05,360 --> 00:13:10,880
and you got little hooks. So that just

308
00:13:07,279 --> 00:13:13,680
kind of bends in there, bends in, bends

309
00:13:10,880 --> 00:13:16,720
in and locks into place. So that holds

310
00:13:13,680 --> 00:13:19,120
it. And you got this little door. You

311
00:13:16,720 --> 00:13:21,440
have your sterno can

312
00:13:19,120 --> 00:13:25,120
and you put it right in there and it

313
00:13:21,440 --> 00:13:27,839
sits dead center. You close up that door

314
00:13:25,120 --> 00:13:30,480
to try to maintain the heat. This is

315
00:13:27,839 --> 00:13:33,600
very thin aluminum, heavy gauge

316
00:13:30,480 --> 00:13:36,720
aluminum, but it's it's aluminum.

317
00:13:33,600 --> 00:13:40,560
And you have your cooking vessel on top.

318
00:13:36,720 --> 00:13:42,800
There you go. That is the late 1980s,

319
00:13:40,560 --> 00:13:44,959
maybe 1970s. I think I've seen

320
00:13:42,800 --> 00:13:48,320
advertisements for these 1970s as well,

321
00:13:44,959 --> 00:13:52,560
but pretty much 1980s, 1990s Sterno

322
00:13:48,320 --> 00:13:55,920
backpacking stove.

323
00:13:52,560 --> 00:14:00,079
All right. Now, those scouts, scouts out

324
00:13:55,920 --> 00:14:03,680
there, they sold these even in the 1990s

325
00:14:00,079 --> 00:14:05,040
when I was a scout. Uh, I have no idea.

326
00:14:03,680 --> 00:14:07,519
Actually, I do have an idea when this

327
00:14:05,040 --> 00:14:10,240
one was made. This was made in the 1950s

328
00:14:07,519 --> 00:14:13,279
because it says Boy Scouts of America,

329
00:14:10,240 --> 00:14:18,720
National Council, New York City. So,

330
00:14:13,279 --> 00:14:21,680
this is an old one. Uh, patented

331
00:14:18,720 --> 00:14:24,160
Milwaukee, USA Corporation,

332
00:14:21,680 --> 00:14:26,959
uh, JW

333
00:14:24,160 --> 00:14:28,720
speaker on the back of it. I didn't know

334
00:14:26,959 --> 00:14:30,160
these things were that old. I This is

335
00:14:28,720 --> 00:14:32,320
like the first time I actually analyzed

336
00:14:30,160 --> 00:14:34,160
that stamp. So, I didn't realize this

337
00:14:32,320 --> 00:14:37,760
was from the 1950s. I thought this was

338
00:14:34,160 --> 00:14:41,600
much newer. Like I said, they had these

339
00:14:37,760 --> 00:14:43,839
even when I was a scout in the 90s.

340
00:14:41,600 --> 00:14:47,519
So, you have this aluminum container.

341
00:14:43,839 --> 00:14:52,519
Inside of it is

342
00:14:47,519 --> 00:14:52,519
a cardboard box. If I can get it out.

343
00:14:52,800 --> 00:14:58,800
Uh, I don't want to ruin it.

344
00:14:55,920 --> 00:15:03,480
Don't want to tear it up.

345
00:14:58,800 --> 00:15:03,480
Come on. Come on. Get out. All right.

346
00:15:04,480 --> 00:15:07,680
You have these little heat tabs. These

347
00:15:06,240 --> 00:15:10,399
are very similar to the heat tabs that

348
00:15:07,680 --> 00:15:14,480
the military used uh even in Vietnam.

349
00:15:10,399 --> 00:15:17,120
And when I was a kid, we had this uh GI

350
00:15:14,480 --> 00:15:19,519
uh depot place that had like surplus

351
00:15:17,120 --> 00:15:22,399
gear and stuff. They used to sell

352
00:15:19,519 --> 00:15:25,360
military tabs. And my gosh, as a scout,

353
00:15:22,399 --> 00:15:28,160
those things were so awesome to either

354
00:15:25,360 --> 00:15:30,720
cook with or start a fire with cuz they

355
00:15:28,160 --> 00:15:34,079
light right up and they would be blue

356
00:15:30,720 --> 00:15:36,320
and hot. boy, you could do anything with

357
00:15:34,079 --> 00:15:38,800
them. So, let me uh move the camera so

358
00:15:36,320 --> 00:15:40,959
you can take a look at this.

359
00:15:38,800 --> 00:15:43,440
So, here you go. This is the uh this is

360
00:15:40,959 --> 00:15:45,120
the tab. See how small they are? So, you

361
00:15:43,440 --> 00:15:47,120
get a bunch of them. This has never been

362
00:15:45,120 --> 00:15:50,240
used. I'm not going to light one for you

363
00:15:47,120 --> 00:15:53,120
because well, that wouldn't be very uh

364
00:15:50,240 --> 00:15:56,720
historical of me to do that. And you can

365
00:15:53,120 --> 00:16:00,000
kind of see here 101 uses speaker heat

366
00:15:56,720 --> 00:16:02,399
tabs trademark register tablets or

367
00:16:00,000 --> 00:16:05,040
concentrated heat of concentrated heat

368
00:16:02,399 --> 00:16:07,360
fry heat or boil.

369
00:16:05,040 --> 00:16:09,279
Outdoors use large size heat tabs for

370
00:16:07,360 --> 00:16:12,000
hunting, fishing, starting campfires,

371
00:16:09,279 --> 00:16:14,320
emergency sterilization, etc. Indoors

372
00:16:12,000 --> 00:16:17,360
small use small size heat tabs for

373
00:16:14,320 --> 00:16:19,759
heating baby's milk. Quick hot water for

374
00:16:17,360 --> 00:16:22,880
shaving. Sick room heating coffee

375
00:16:19,759 --> 00:16:27,199
anywhere, bedside uses, etc. Two hours

376
00:16:22,880 --> 00:16:30,160
of heat in this box. Isn't that cool?

377
00:16:27,199 --> 00:16:32,320
I don't know if I can uh show you that.

378
00:16:30,160 --> 00:16:33,920
When you buy refills of heat tabs,

379
00:16:32,320 --> 00:16:36,639
specify

380
00:16:33,920 --> 00:16:39,759
of 24 heat tabs, large size or package

381
00:16:36,639 --> 00:16:42,639
of 24 heat tabs, medium size by the

382
00:16:39,759 --> 00:16:44,720
speaker core. There you go.

383
00:16:42,639 --> 00:16:47,839
That cool.

384
00:16:44,720 --> 00:16:49,920
Isn't that cool?

385
00:16:47,839 --> 00:16:52,880
You kind of see what they look like up

386
00:16:49,920 --> 00:16:52,880
close.

387
00:16:55,199 --> 00:16:59,920
So, these were sold to scouts. Like I

388
00:16:57,680 --> 00:17:03,120
said, they had these when I was a kid.

389
00:16:59,920 --> 00:17:07,039
Uh I I got to play around with them when

390
00:17:03,120 --> 00:17:10,559
I was a kid, and they worked really

391
00:17:07,039 --> 00:17:12,720
well. Surprisingly well. And as always

392
00:17:10,559 --> 00:17:15,280
with hunting or camping gear, I love how

393
00:17:12,720 --> 00:17:16,959
small it all packs down. So, as you

394
00:17:15,280 --> 00:17:18,480
bring this up, you've got your air

395
00:17:16,959 --> 00:17:20,559
circulation coming through. There's

396
00:17:18,480 --> 00:17:22,559
holes there. So again, you got your air

397
00:17:20,559 --> 00:17:24,959
circulation. Then you take your Boy

398
00:17:22,559 --> 00:17:26,799
Scout mess kit, I'm sure, and you put

399
00:17:24,959 --> 00:17:30,400
over top of it. And there you go. You

400
00:17:26,799 --> 00:17:33,520
got your stove right there. I mean, that

401
00:17:30,400 --> 00:17:35,840
is that is small, right? Like that's

402
00:17:33,520 --> 00:17:37,919
that's pretty cool. When you're thinking

403
00:17:35,840 --> 00:17:40,480
about backpacking

404
00:17:37,919 --> 00:17:44,880
or long-distance trekking, saving

405
00:17:40,480 --> 00:17:46,640
weight, this this is the ideal, right? I

406
00:17:44,880 --> 00:17:48,480
know they got like those fire boxes you

407
00:17:46,640 --> 00:17:50,640
can put sticks in. I know we got our

408
00:17:48,480 --> 00:17:53,760
whisper lights and stuff like that, but

409
00:17:50,640 --> 00:17:56,080
if you could have just some heat tabs

410
00:17:53,760 --> 00:17:58,880
and one or two heat tabs could cook your

411
00:17:56,080 --> 00:18:01,440
meal,

412
00:17:58,880 --> 00:18:04,240
that's pretty sweet. These things weigh

413
00:18:01,440 --> 00:18:08,960
a lot less than having liquid. You think

414
00:18:04,240 --> 00:18:11,919
about like you know 5 lb 10 lb um of

415
00:18:08,960 --> 00:18:14,559
fuel to really take care of you know a

416
00:18:11,919 --> 00:18:16,640
whole group of people whereas each

417
00:18:14,559 --> 00:18:19,679
person just has something like this 24

418
00:18:16,640 --> 00:18:23,200
heat tabs then that will take care of

419
00:18:19,679 --> 00:18:24,799
you for the entire weekend for sure. All

420
00:18:23,200 --> 00:18:27,600
right.

421
00:18:24,799 --> 00:18:29,440
So, there you go, my friends. That is my

422
00:18:27,600 --> 00:18:31,840
collection. And I think I have a few

423
00:18:29,440 --> 00:18:33,760
more. And uh if you're interested in the

424
00:18:31,840 --> 00:18:35,520
press and mess, then check out the

425
00:18:33,760 --> 00:18:38,720
description box below because this thing

426
00:18:35,520 --> 00:18:40,640
is so cool. Like I said before, you've

427
00:18:38,720 --> 00:18:43,520
got your skillet

428
00:18:40,640 --> 00:18:45,360
like so. You've got your plate, you've

429
00:18:43,520 --> 00:18:46,880
got your cup, which all folds down. See

430
00:18:45,360 --> 00:18:49,760
the handle on there? And you got your

431
00:18:46,880 --> 00:18:51,840
canteen all together, right? It's in the

432
00:18:49,760 --> 00:18:53,600
description box below. We need 500

433
00:18:51,840 --> 00:18:56,960
people to make this thing a reality. I'd

434
00:18:53,600 --> 00:18:59,600
love it if you join us. Also, I want to

435
00:18:56,960 --> 00:19:02,160
invite you. There's a limited number of

436
00:18:59,600 --> 00:19:05,200
spots available at the Camp Crafters

437
00:19:02,160 --> 00:19:07,600
Guild Squirrel Camp. Now, in October

438
00:19:05,200 --> 00:19:10,000
from it's a 4-day squirrel camp, right?

439
00:19:07,600 --> 00:19:12,799
From October 22nd to the 26th. You leave

440
00:19:10,000 --> 00:19:14,400
on Sunday the 26th, right? By 11. Um

441
00:19:12,799 --> 00:19:17,280
they're at Dave Canter's property in

442
00:19:14,400 --> 00:19:21,600
southeastern Ohio. He's hosting us for

443
00:19:17,280 --> 00:19:23,280
the second annual squirrel camp. And if

444
00:19:21,600 --> 00:19:26,320
you don't want to hunt, you can just c

445
00:19:23,280 --> 00:19:28,960
come and camp in historic, you know,

446
00:19:26,320 --> 00:19:31,520
garb and equipment. You do have to have

447
00:19:28,960 --> 00:19:33,440
period equipment and garb to participate

448
00:19:31,520 --> 00:19:36,160
because this is a full immersive

449
00:19:33,440 --> 00:19:39,440
experience. If you've ever wanted to

450
00:19:36,160 --> 00:19:42,080
experience an old school early 20th

451
00:19:39,440 --> 00:19:44,320
century hunting camp, this is where you

452
00:19:42,080 --> 00:19:47,120
can do it. So, it's really unique from

453
00:19:44,320 --> 00:19:50,559
other reenactments or living histories

454
00:19:47,120 --> 00:19:53,360
because this is truly an immersive

455
00:19:50,559 --> 00:19:56,559
camping experience. You're cooking just

456
00:19:53,360 --> 00:19:59,520
like they did in the mid well early 20th

457
00:19:56,559 --> 00:20:00,720
century. You're sleeping in the early

458
00:19:59,520 --> 00:20:02,640
20th century. You're dressed in the

459
00:20:00,720 --> 00:20:04,480
early 20th century. And you're hunting

460
00:20:02,640 --> 00:20:07,679
just like you would in the early 20th

461
00:20:04,480 --> 00:20:09,360
century. So, if you have that kind of

462
00:20:07,679 --> 00:20:11,200
kit or if you're wanting to get one of

463
00:20:09,360 --> 00:20:13,120
those kits together, which will help

464
00:20:11,200 --> 00:20:14,400
you, right? will guide you in the right

465
00:20:13,120 --> 00:20:18,080
direction and everything to start your

466
00:20:14,400 --> 00:20:21,520
journey. Then join us at the second

467
00:20:18,080 --> 00:20:24,000

they're going to be our camp cooks and

489
00:21:06,159 --> 00:21:09,440
Sarge has already got something awesome

490
00:21:07,840 --> 00:21:11,039
planned for those guys who are actually

00:21:13,520 --> 00:21:18,880
having a camp lunch. Uh so you can

494
00:21:16,720 --> 00:21:21,840
participate in that if you so choose. is

495
00:21:18,880 --> 00:21:25,679
an additional charge, but it will be a

496
00:21:21,840 --> 00:21:29,280
true immersive camp cook hunting camp

497
00:21:25,679 --> 00:21:31,440
experience that uh I know you enjoy. But

498
00:21:29,280 --> 00:21:32,880
it's limited to 25 people. So, if you

499
00:21:31,440 --> 00:21:35,440
want to be one of those 25 people, you

500
00:21:32,880 --> 00:21:37,760
need to get locked in now and uh don't

501
00:21:35,440 --> 00:21:41,679
wait till the last minute because last

502
00:21:37,760 --> 00:21:43,039
year, you know, we had almost 25 people.

503
00:21:41,679 --> 00:21:46,400
We weren't there quite yet, but we

504
00:21:43,039 --> 00:21:48,880
almost had 25 people and they got first

505
00:21:46,400 --> 00:21:51,440
invite. Since they came last year, they

506
00:21:48,880 --> 00:21:53,600
got invitation to take up spots that are

507
00:21:51,440 --> 00:21:55,440
now available for this year. And uh

508
00:21:53,600 --> 00:21:57,360
that's just how we'll do it. So if you

509
00:21:55,440 --> 00:21:59,760
come, then you will pretty much be

510
00:21:57,360 --> 00:22:02,000
locked in to your invite the following

511
00:21:59,760 --> 00:22:03,440

512
00:22:02,000 --> 00:22:04,960
you uh if you've ever been to a living

513
00:22:03,440 --> 00:22:08,480
history event, you see the same people

514
00:22:04,960 --> 00:22:12,080
over and over again. you build a like a

515
00:22:08,480 --> 00:22:14,080
family type feeling and it's a just an

516
00:22:12,080 --> 00:22:16,159
incredible

517
00:22:14,080 --> 00:22:17,600
it's an incredible experience. It really

518
00:22:16,159 --> 00:22:20,159
is when you get to go to reenact and you

519
00:22:17,600 --> 00:22:22,080
see some of the familiar uh faces and

520
00:22:20,159 --> 00:22:23,520
you're sharing some stories. You know,

521
00:22:22,080 --> 00:22:26,960
you might not see each other but once or

522
00:22:23,520 --> 00:22:29,039
