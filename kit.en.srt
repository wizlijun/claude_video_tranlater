1
00:00:00,560 --> 00:00:05,839
And the handle pulls out. Kind of snaps

2
00:00:02,879 --> 00:00:08,320
in place. And it has right here on the

3
00:00:05,839 --> 00:00:11,720
rear. Now it's completely sealed. And we

4
00:00:08,320 --> 00:00:11,720
have a little oven.

5
00:00:15,040 --> 00:00:18,320
Hello. Welcome to Waypoint Survival.

6
00:00:16,880 --> 00:00:21,279
Today we're going to talk about Horus

7
00:00:18,320 --> 00:00:23,519
Keart's amazing cook kit. Stay tuned.

8
00:00:21,279 --> 00:00:26,400
Sometime in the 1890s, a gentleman by

9
00:00:23,519 --> 00:00:30,080
the name of Guy Preston invented this

10
00:00:26,400 --> 00:00:32,559
messkit cook kit canteen combination.

11
00:00:30,080 --> 00:00:34,719
Now, this was a special purchase item.

12
00:00:32,559 --> 00:00:37,280
As far as we know, it was never an issue

13
00:00:34,719 --> 00:00:39,360
item to the army. Of course, I'm sure he

14
00:00:37,280 --> 00:00:43,440
wanted that to happen, but this was

15
00:00:39,360 --> 00:00:45,040
picked up and sold to officers perhaps,

16
00:00:43,440 --> 00:00:47,200
uh, people that had some money because

17
00:00:45,040 --> 00:00:48,960
this was expensive even back in the day,

18
00:00:47,200 --> 00:00:51,440
but purchased by their families perhaps

19
00:00:48,960 --> 00:00:54,320
before they went off to war. So, this

20
00:00:51,440 --> 00:00:56,960
would have been predating the Spanishame

21
00:00:54,320 --> 00:00:59,440
War of 1898 and then on into the early

22
00:00:56,960 --> 00:01:01,760
1900s. And this was sold even by

23
00:00:59,440 --> 00:01:04,159
Abbercrombie and Fitch on into the

24
00:01:01,760 --> 00:01:06,320
1920s. I'm not sure when they stopped

25
00:01:04,159 --> 00:01:09,040
selling it, but this is a very difficult

26
00:01:06,320 --> 00:01:10,560
item to get a hold of. Now, Horus Kart

27
00:01:09,040 --> 00:01:13,119
had one of these. And as a matter of

28
00:01:10,560 --> 00:01:15,280
fact, if you look in the museum that has

29
00:01:13,119 --> 00:01:17,680
the remainder of his stuff, you will

30
00:01:15,280 --> 00:01:20,159
find this in his kit items. The clues

31
00:01:17,680 --> 00:01:22,400
that we have as to what he carried is

32
00:01:20,159 --> 00:01:24,960
now housed at the Western Carolina

33
00:01:22,400 --> 00:01:26,880
University. And they have all of the

34
00:01:24,960 --> 00:01:29,520
items that were left. Mr. Keepart

35
00:01:26,880 --> 00:01:31,920
unfortunately died in 1931 in a car

36
00:01:29,520 --> 00:01:34,079
accident. One of his good friends, I

37
00:01:31,920 --> 00:01:36,000
think a lawyer, uh something like that,

38
00:01:34,079 --> 00:01:38,159
had these items. They were in storage

39
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:40,880
for a while and ultimately they end up

40
00:01:38,159 --> 00:01:42,240
being donated to the university and you

41
00:01:40,880 --> 00:01:43,759
can go online and you can find pictures

42
00:01:42,240 --> 00:01:45,840
of them. But this is one of the things

43
00:01:43,759 --> 00:01:48,479
that he had and carried. Now, Horus

44
00:01:45,840 --> 00:01:50,720
Keart, like a lot of us modern survival

45
00:01:48,479 --> 00:01:52,399
bushcraft guys, uh we test different

46
00:01:50,720 --> 00:01:53,759
gear items and we don't know if he

47
00:01:52,399 --> 00:01:55,600
purchased this or if this was sent to

48
00:01:53,759 --> 00:01:57,520
him. I think it was sent to him, but he

49
00:01:55,600 --> 00:02:00,320
did enjoy it. He did like it and he

50
00:01:57,520 --> 00:02:02,560
wrote well about it. So, I managed to

51
00:02:00,320 --> 00:02:04,880
get a hold of one of these and as part

52
00:02:02,560 --> 00:02:07,360
of the Camplike Kart series, I'm going

53
00:02:04,880 --> 00:02:09,280
to show you what this is like. Now,

54
00:02:07,360 --> 00:02:11,200
there's a special thing that's coming up

55
00:02:09,280 --> 00:02:13,520
where you may be able to purchase one of

56
00:02:11,200 --> 00:02:14,879
these. So, stay tuned to the end of the

57
00:02:13,520 --> 00:02:16,560
video so I can give you that

58
00:02:14,879 --> 00:02:18,400
information. One of the things that you

59
00:02:16,560 --> 00:02:21,680
notice when you first get one of these

60
00:02:18,400 --> 00:02:23,920
kits is that it's kind of an unusual

61
00:02:21,680 --> 00:02:26,800
configuration. Now, there are many

62
00:02:23,920 --> 00:02:30,080
different types of carriers that these

63
00:02:26,800 --> 00:02:31,920
came with or that were made for them and

64
00:02:30,080 --> 00:02:34,400
probably would depend on who is the

65
00:02:31,920 --> 00:02:36,640
retailer and even if someone would have

66
00:02:34,400 --> 00:02:39,200
a private individual make one for them.

67
00:02:36,640 --> 00:02:41,120
Now, this particular holder here was

68
00:02:39,200 --> 00:02:42,080
sold by Abberrombi and Fitch. And for

69
00:02:41,120 --> 00:02:44,560
those of you who don't know,

70
00:02:42,080 --> 00:02:47,200
Abberrombian Fitch was the premier

71
00:02:44,560 --> 00:02:49,760
retailer of outdoor accessories for the

72
00:02:47,200 --> 00:02:52,640
serious sportsman. So, it wasn't just a

73
00:02:49,760 --> 00:02:54,080
yepy clothing store as it is today. And

74
00:02:52,640 --> 00:02:56,720
now I'd like to thank the sponsor of

75
00:02:54,080 --> 00:02:59,120
today's video, Mave. Whether we're out

76
00:02:56,720 --> 00:03:02,239
on the trail or just sitting around a

77
00:02:59,120 --> 00:03:04,640
campfire, my dog isn't just a companion.

78
00:03:02,239 --> 00:03:06,879
He's like family. And just like I'm

79
00:03:04,640 --> 00:03:08,640
serious about what I put in my body,

80
00:03:06,879 --> 00:03:10,879
it's good to want the same level of care

81
00:03:08,640 --> 00:03:13,440
for him back at home. Mave isn't your

82
00:03:10,879 --> 00:03:15,599
typical dog food. It's raw, human-grade,

83
00:03:13,440 --> 00:03:17,840
nutrient-rich food designed to give your

84
00:03:15,599 --> 00:03:19,360
dog everything they need to thrive.

85
00:03:17,840 --> 00:03:21,680
Whether they're a wilderness cruiser

86
00:03:19,360 --> 00:03:23,760
like mine or just your everyday couch

87
00:03:21,680 --> 00:03:25,680
buddy, it comes frozen to lock in

88
00:03:23,760 --> 00:03:28,319
freshness. Just scoop it straight from

89
00:03:25,680 --> 00:03:30,480
the freezer or you can let it thaw for a

90
00:03:28,319 --> 00:03:33,040
few minutes. What I really love about

91
00:03:30,480 --> 00:03:35,040
it, Mave has thought of everything from

92
00:03:33,040 --> 00:03:37,519
their daily vitamin bars, which my dog

93
00:03:35,040 --> 00:03:39,360
devours just like a treat, to their bone

94
00:03:37,519 --> 00:03:41,840
broth toppers, which you can add for an

95
00:03:39,360 --> 00:03:44,720
extra nutritional boost. This isn't just

96
00:03:41,840 --> 00:03:46,720
food. It's a complete system for K9

97
00:03:44,720 --> 00:03:49,519
health. It's crafted to support seven

98
00:03:46,720 --> 00:03:52,000
key areas of my dog's well-being. Oral

99
00:03:49,519 --> 00:03:55,120
health, weight and digestion, immunity,

100
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:57,120
anxiety, joints, skin and coat. It even

101
00:03:55,120 --> 00:03:58,799
helps with proper puppy development.

102
00:03:57,120 --> 00:04:01,040
With Mave, your dog will definitely want

103
00:03:58,799 --> 00:04:02,560
to be part of the Clean Bowl Club. So,

104
00:04:01,040 --> 00:04:04,879
if you're ready to take your dog's

105
00:04:02,560 --> 00:04:06,480
health as seriously as your own, check

106
00:04:04,879 --> 00:04:09,280
out the link in the description box

107
00:04:06,480 --> 00:04:11,439
below or scan the QR code that's been

108
00:04:09,280 --> 00:04:13,519
showing on your screen to check out Mave

109
00:04:11,439 --> 00:04:15,840
because your best friend deserves the

110
00:04:13,519 --> 00:04:17,359
best fuel for all of life's adventures.

111
00:04:15,840 --> 00:04:19,440
All right, let's get into this. So,

112
00:04:17,359 --> 00:04:21,600
you'll notice that there's kind of a sho

113
00:04:19,440 --> 00:04:24,800
string, a cord here that holds this

114
00:04:21,600 --> 00:04:26,960
open, and then it's just a series of

115
00:04:24,800 --> 00:04:30,000
speed laces

116
00:04:26,960 --> 00:04:33,520
that unwinds here. You can take this

117
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:36,320
like that and then we can access the

118
00:04:33,520 --> 00:04:37,919
kit.

119
00:04:36,320 --> 00:04:41,840
Of course, you'll notice immediately

120
00:04:37,919 --> 00:04:45,360
that there's a canteen here and it was

121
00:04:41,840 --> 00:04:47,520
sealed with just a cork.

122
00:04:45,360 --> 00:04:50,160
Removing that, we look inside here and

123
00:04:47,520 --> 00:04:52,240
we can see that it is lined with felt

124
00:04:50,160 --> 00:04:53,919
and this is to insulate it in the winter

125
00:04:52,240 --> 00:04:56,160
time. But you could also soak this in

126
00:04:53,919 --> 00:04:58,800
the water and this would through

127
00:04:56,160 --> 00:05:01,280
evaporation and evaporational cooling it

128
00:04:58,800 --> 00:05:04,400
would help keep your canteen water cool.

129
00:05:01,280 --> 00:05:07,440
The way this particular bag is made and

130
00:05:04,400 --> 00:05:09,919
if you want to see the old Abberrombie

131
00:05:07,440 --> 00:05:12,639
and Fitch label,

132
00:05:09,919 --> 00:05:14,479
there it is.

133
00:05:12,639 --> 00:05:16,800
But the way that this bag is made, you

134
00:05:14,479 --> 00:05:20,400
can pull this felt back and there is an

135
00:05:16,800 --> 00:05:27,120
angled pocket down inside and there is

136
00:05:20,400 --> 00:05:31,720
enough room for a fork and a spoon.

137
00:05:27,120 --> 00:05:31,720
So again, down inside

138
00:05:32,080 --> 00:05:35,919
and it fits in there quite securely. And

139
00:05:34,160 --> 00:05:37,840
then when you put this on, then it

140
00:05:35,919 --> 00:05:40,639
protects it from rattling around in your

141
00:05:37,840 --> 00:05:43,680
gear. Pretty ingenious. And then this is

142
00:05:40,639 --> 00:05:45,840
just a cotton type strap. It does look

143
00:05:43,680 --> 00:05:47,840
like it's been repaired perhaps or

144
00:05:45,840 --> 00:05:50,720
shortened at some point in its life.

145
00:05:47,840 --> 00:05:52,160
There's a repair right there. And uh

146
00:05:50,720 --> 00:05:55,360
still in pretty good shape though. It is

147
00:05:52,160 --> 00:05:57,840
a waxed canvas. And I do like that about

148
00:05:55,360 --> 00:06:00,400
it. Next, we get into the heart of the

149
00:05:57,840 --> 00:06:03,360
matter, which is what makes this kit so

150
00:06:00,400 --> 00:06:06,639
unique.

151
00:06:03,360 --> 00:06:09,759
It has a clamshell type arrangement on

152
00:06:06,639 --> 00:06:13,319
either side.

153
00:06:09,759 --> 00:06:13,319
So you can see that

154
00:06:13,440 --> 00:06:18,160
the canteen rides in the middle. Has a

155
00:06:16,080 --> 00:06:20,160
little bit of a divot here. Now these

156
00:06:18,160 --> 00:06:22,240
also came with what was called a half

157
00:06:20,160 --> 00:06:24,160
canteen. So the canteen was only half

158
00:06:22,240 --> 00:06:25,440
the size. And that would allow you to

159
00:06:24,160 --> 00:06:27,680
put a little bit of food down in the

160
00:06:25,440 --> 00:06:29,600
bottom if you want. But I would have

161
00:06:27,680 --> 00:06:32,400
probably even back in the day preferred

162
00:06:29,600 --> 00:06:34,800
the full length canteen. And these were

163
00:06:32,400 --> 00:06:36,720
tinned. And so many of these, as you can

164
00:06:34,800 --> 00:06:38,639
see, this one has rust on it. Many of

165
00:06:36,720 --> 00:06:41,199
them rusted very badly. They were

166
00:06:38,639 --> 00:06:43,120
soldered together with uh solder that

167
00:06:41,199 --> 00:06:44,639
more than likely had lead in it. Uh this

168
00:06:43,120 --> 00:06:46,560
one has had a significant amount of

169
00:06:44,639 --> 00:06:48,800
repairs done to it where it had rusted

170
00:06:46,560 --> 00:06:51,120
through and started leaking. So really

171
00:06:48,800 --> 00:06:53,280
this is more for looks. Now I do have a

172
00:06:51,120 --> 00:06:54,639
replacement one that's made from copper

173
00:06:53,280 --> 00:06:56,720
that I got from the gentleman when I

174
00:06:54,639 --> 00:06:58,160
bought this kit and uh it is good enough

175
00:06:56,720 --> 00:07:00,160
to carry water in. But this one right

176
00:06:58,160 --> 00:07:02,800
here is really just to keep it original.

177
00:07:00,160 --> 00:07:05,120
Now this is the cup or the pot and the

178
00:07:02,800 --> 00:07:07,120
canteen nests in it. So, we'll set that

179
00:07:05,120 --> 00:07:09,039
to the side. And this has some unique

180
00:07:07,120 --> 00:07:11,599
features. If you look down inside, you

181
00:07:09,039 --> 00:07:13,680
can see that is the handle. And the

182
00:07:11,599 --> 00:07:17,039
handle pulls out. Kind of snaps in

183
00:07:13,680 --> 00:07:19,919
place. And it has right here on the rear

184
00:07:17,039 --> 00:07:21,680
something that rotates. Okay? See that?

185
00:07:19,919 --> 00:07:24,720
So, you put this on the flat. You pull

186
00:07:21,680 --> 00:07:26,800
this over. And then you would spin that.

187
00:07:24,720 --> 00:07:28,960
And that locks that into place so that

188
00:07:26,800 --> 00:07:31,599
we can now cook over the fire. Has a

189
00:07:28,960 --> 00:07:34,240
somewhat of a flat bottom so it sets.

190
00:07:31,599 --> 00:07:36,479
Okay. But this is really unique and it's

191
00:07:34,240 --> 00:07:38,240
big enough that this is going to hold a

192
00:07:36,479 --> 00:07:39,840
decent sized can of beans or whatever

193
00:07:38,240 --> 00:07:41,840
you're uh cooking pork and beans

194
00:07:39,840 --> 00:07:44,240
perhaps. And that's a really unique

195
00:07:41,840 --> 00:07:46,479
feature. Uh it's very easy to handle.

196
00:07:44,240 --> 00:07:48,080
And this kit is made from aluminum in

197
00:07:46,479 --> 00:07:50,400
case you were wondering. The next item,

198
00:07:48,080 --> 00:07:53,919
the first part of the clam shell is your

199
00:07:50,400 --> 00:07:55,599
plate. And it's got a little bit of a a

200
00:07:53,919 --> 00:07:56,879
loop here. You see you can little ring

201
00:07:55,599 --> 00:07:59,199
so you can hang that up if you want to

202
00:07:56,879 --> 00:08:01,759
dry it. And then it's got a place for a

203
00:07:59,199 --> 00:08:03,360
pin on the other side. Get to that in a

204
00:08:01,759 --> 00:08:05,440
minute.

205
00:08:03,360 --> 00:08:08,240
The other half of the clamshell is your

206
00:08:05,440 --> 00:08:11,919
frying pan. So, here's the handle. This

207
00:08:08,240 --> 00:08:16,400
opens up like this. And there is right

208
00:08:11,919 --> 00:08:19,360
here a little sliding pin. So, when you

209
00:08:16,400 --> 00:08:22,560
open this up like this, there's a hole

210
00:08:19,360 --> 00:08:24,800
right here. This slides into there.

211
00:08:22,560 --> 00:08:26,960
Pushes down and locks into place. It's

212
00:08:24,800 --> 00:08:28,879
nice and sturdy. And this is a handy

213
00:08:26,960 --> 00:08:31,039
dandy frying pan. I mean, it's a good

214
00:08:28,879 --> 00:08:32,880
size. It's deep enough that you can fry

215
00:08:31,039 --> 00:08:34,800
eggs or bacon or anything like that for

216
00:08:32,880 --> 00:08:36,399
breakfast and it will do a really good

217
00:08:34,800 --> 00:08:38,399
job of that. Now, there's something else

218
00:08:36,399 --> 00:08:41,440
that this kit does that makes this so

219
00:08:38,399 --> 00:08:43,680
unique and so worth having. So, if we

220
00:08:41,440 --> 00:08:47,200
take this pin and pull this back out, so

221
00:08:43,680 --> 00:08:51,200
the handle rotates on the frying pan,

222
00:08:47,200 --> 00:08:54,000
we've got this square ring right here.

223
00:08:51,200 --> 00:08:59,279
And you'll notice that there's a hook.

224
00:08:54,000 --> 00:09:02,080
This hooks onto that just like this.

225
00:08:59,279 --> 00:09:04,640
And then this goes down inside

226
00:09:02,080 --> 00:09:09,040
just like that.

227
00:09:04,640 --> 00:09:10,480
And it nests inside the top pan.

228
00:09:09,040 --> 00:09:14,760
Now, these can be a little bit difficult

229
00:09:10,480 --> 00:09:14,760
to get together because of their age.

230
00:09:16,399 --> 00:09:23,040
Once you get that in place, then the pin

231
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:25,279
should go ahead and push in right here.

232
00:09:23,040 --> 00:09:28,000
Just like that. Now it's completely

233
00:09:25,279 --> 00:09:31,200
sealed and we have a little oven. We can

234
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:33,839
use this to bake our bread. And I just

235
00:09:31,200 --> 00:09:36,160
think that is super clever. You can also

236
00:09:33,839 --> 00:09:38,959
use this to store food long term. Let's

237
00:09:36,160 --> 00:09:40,720
say you're leaving camp and you want to

238
00:09:38,959 --> 00:09:43,120
just stick this in your pack. There's

239
00:09:40,720 --> 00:09:45,600
plenty of room uh in your backpack for

240
00:09:43,120 --> 00:09:48,720
that hopefully. But in here, there's

241
00:09:45,600 --> 00:09:52,399
absolutely no problem with carrying just

242
00:09:48,720 --> 00:09:56,640
the canteen and the cup or the pot. Snap

243
00:09:52,399 --> 00:09:58,880
that back into place. This goes in.

244
00:09:56,640 --> 00:10:00,720
We close this up and then this becomes

245
00:09:58,880 --> 00:10:02,320
your extra food storage. Of course,

246
00:10:00,720 --> 00:10:03,760
nothing that would leak or run or

247
00:10:02,320 --> 00:10:05,040
anything like that. But you could see

248
00:10:03,760 --> 00:10:06,720
making some trail bread or some

249
00:10:05,040 --> 00:10:08,800
cornbread or something like that and

250
00:10:06,720 --> 00:10:10,800
just keeping this for later would be

251
00:10:08,800 --> 00:10:13,040
just extremely convenient. Putting the

252
00:10:10,800 --> 00:10:16,079
whole kit back together is super simple.

253
00:10:13,040 --> 00:10:21,040
Again, we just nest this.

254
00:10:16,079 --> 00:10:24,800
We put this on one side and this on the

255
00:10:21,040 --> 00:10:26,640
other. Just like that. And that's it.

256
00:10:24,800 --> 00:10:29,120
goes back inside the bag. It's got your

257
00:10:26,640 --> 00:10:31,040
silverware. It's got your oven. It has

258
00:10:29,120 --> 00:10:32,560
your plate, your frying pan. And because

259
00:10:31,040 --> 00:10:34,480
of the way that it's made with the mouth

260
00:10:32,560 --> 00:10:36,880
of the canteen being exposed above the

261
00:10:34,480 --> 00:10:40,800
whole kit, it's an easy thing to open

262
00:10:36,880 --> 00:10:42,880
that up and drink from it. So, works

263
00:10:40,800 --> 00:10:45,760
perfectly as a canteen during the day.

264
00:10:42,880 --> 00:10:47,760
When you stop for camp or for the

265
00:10:45,760 --> 00:10:49,760
afternoon for a meal, everything's right

266
00:10:47,760 --> 00:10:51,760
to hand. It's easily accessible. It

267
00:10:49,760 --> 00:10:53,760
doesn't weigh a whole lot. And I can

268
00:10:51,760 --> 00:10:56,240
just see this is a a phenomenal piece of

269
00:10:53,760 --> 00:10:58,160
gear. It's no wonder Horus Kart liked

270
00:10:56,240 --> 00:11:00,160
it. And now for some great news. A lot

271
00:10:58,160 --> 00:11:02,560
of the kits and the gear that I show you

272
00:11:00,160 --> 00:11:05,440
are almost impossible to find. This is

273
00:11:02,560 --> 00:11:06,720
extremely rare in today's world, and I

274
00:11:05,440 --> 00:11:08,560
don't think that there was a whole lot

275
00:11:06,720 --> 00:11:10,720
of them sold back in the day, which is

276
00:11:08,560 --> 00:11:12,560
why so few of them have existed down to

277
00:11:10,720 --> 00:11:15,519
modern times.

278
00:11:12,560 --> 00:11:17,360
However, my friend, Mr. Sha Dyer of the

279
00:11:15,519 --> 00:11:18,959
Honorable Outfitters, Mr. Dyer's

280
00:11:17,360 --> 00:11:20,959
Musings, and I'll make sure and put his

281
00:11:18,959 --> 00:11:24,240
channel link down in the description box

282
00:11:20,959 --> 00:11:26,959
as well. He wants to reproduce these.

283
00:11:24,240 --> 00:11:28,720
Now, it'll be in 318 stainless steel, so

284
00:11:26,959 --> 00:11:30,720
not aluminum. Again, we know there could

285
00:11:28,720 --> 00:11:32,640
be problems with aluminum, especially

286
00:11:30,720 --> 00:11:35,120
buildup over time. So, it's going to be

287
00:11:32,640 --> 00:11:36,560
in a good grade of stainless steel. He's

288
00:11:35,120 --> 00:11:38,880
planning to take this, he's got a couple

289
00:11:36,560 --> 00:11:40,800
of originals himself, and he's going to

290
00:11:38,880 --> 00:11:42,399
take it to Columbus, Ohio, and he's

291
00:11:40,800 --> 00:11:44,880
going to have a company there scan it,

292
00:11:42,399 --> 00:11:47,680
and they're going to reproduce this.

293
00:11:44,880 --> 00:11:50,079
You're going to do 500 of them. Now,

294
00:11:47,680 --> 00:11:51,680
these are not going to be cheap. They

295
00:11:50,079 --> 00:11:54,720
weren't cheap in the beginning, but the

296
00:11:51,680 --> 00:11:56,320
reproductions are going to cost $175.

297
00:11:54,720 --> 00:11:58,079
Now, I know that sounds like a lot, but

298
00:11:56,320 --> 00:12:00,560
this is a chance to get something that

299
00:11:58,079 --> 00:12:03,040
is absolutely unique in the outdoor

300
00:12:00,560 --> 00:12:04,399
world. And if you like doing reenacting,

301
00:12:03,040 --> 00:12:06,240
this is definitely something that you

302
00:12:04,399 --> 00:12:07,839
want to have in your kit. There are a

303
00:12:06,240 --> 00:12:09,680
couple things to know about the kit that

304
00:12:07,839 --> 00:12:11,839
he is reproducing. First of all, it

305
00:12:09,680 --> 00:12:14,240
won't have a cork that's not really

306
00:12:11,839 --> 00:12:16,560
secure. It's going to have an internal

307
00:12:14,240 --> 00:12:18,320
frid. Now, if he gets enough orders and

308
00:12:16,560 --> 00:12:20,800
he goes to a second run, he said there's

309
00:12:18,320 --> 00:12:22,959
a possibility he may reproduce some that

310
00:12:20,800 --> 00:12:25,440
are exactly like the original, but for

311
00:12:22,959 --> 00:12:26,959
our modern use, probably a screw cap

312
00:12:25,440 --> 00:12:28,720
would be a lot better. Now, the

313
00:12:26,959 --> 00:12:31,120
reproduction kit, not only will it have

314
00:12:28,720 --> 00:12:34,240
a screw top lid, but will also come with

315
00:12:31,120 --> 00:12:36,800
the frying pan, the plate, the canteen,

316
00:12:34,240 --> 00:12:38,399
and then the canteen cup or pot just as

317
00:12:36,800 --> 00:12:40,160
you see it here. They're going to try to

318
00:12:38,399 --> 00:12:42,959
reproduce it as faithfully as possible.

319
00:12:40,160 --> 00:12:45,920
Again, the only exception being no cork,

320
00:12:42,959 --> 00:12:49,279
a nice screw top lid. The kit will not

321
00:12:45,920 --> 00:12:50,959
come with any kind of a carrier. But Mr.

322
00:12:49,279 --> 00:12:53,040
Dyer said for all of the early

323
00:12:50,959 --> 00:12:54,880
responders, he'll make sure and include

324
00:12:53,040 --> 00:12:56,639
two different patterns where you can

325
00:12:54,880 --> 00:12:58,720
make your own or if you know someone

326
00:12:56,639 --> 00:13:00,560
that can sew, they can make it for you.

327
00:12:58,720 --> 00:13:02,399
That was very common back in the day.

328
00:13:00,560 --> 00:13:03,920
And I know that a lot of you reenactors,

329
00:13:02,399 --> 00:13:05,680
you make your own gear anyway, so it's

330
00:13:03,920 --> 00:13:07,600
not going to be that hard for you. But

331
00:13:05,680 --> 00:13:09,279
anyway, that's nice. a couple of

332
00:13:07,600 --> 00:13:11,360
different patterns of the ones that he

333
00:13:09,279 --> 00:13:13,680
has. Now, there is a time constraint on

334
00:13:11,360 --> 00:13:17,200
this. He needs to have the answer in the

335
00:13:13,680 --> 00:13:18,959
next two days by July 16th, 2025. And I

336
00:13:17,200 --> 00:13:20,880
will make sure and put that link down in

337
00:13:18,959 --> 00:13:22,720
the description box where you can go

338
00:13:20,880 --> 00:13:26,560
there and you can sign up to get one of

339
00:13:22,720 --> 00:13:28,320
these. Now, the $175 is not due right

340
00:13:26,560 --> 00:13:32,720
away, but he does want to get that

341
00:13:28,320 --> 00:13:34,800
payment by August 1st. That $175

342
00:13:32,720 --> 00:13:37,519
does include shipping to the Continental

343
00:13:34,800 --> 00:13:39,360
48 United States. Now, if you live

344
00:13:37,519 --> 00:13:41,279
outside that or you live in some other

345
00:13:39,360 --> 00:13:42,959
part of the world, you can contact Mr.

346
00:13:41,279 --> 00:13:45,120
Dyer. Again, the link will be down below

347
00:13:42,959 --> 00:13:47,040
where you can contact him and he's going

348
00:13:45,120 --> 00:13:49,760
to keep us updated on the progress of

349
00:13:47,040 --> 00:13:51,920
this kit. Now, as many of you as can, we

350
00:13:49,760 --> 00:13:53,360
really need you to jump on board and

351
00:13:51,920 --> 00:13:55,440
order one of these if you can at all

352
00:13:53,360 --> 00:13:57,920
afford it. This would make a fantastic

353
00:13:55,440 --> 00:14:00,000
Christmas gift or birthday present or

354
00:13:57,920 --> 00:14:01,360
just a whatever kind of present for

355
00:14:00,000 --> 00:14:04,160
someone that you know that loves the

356
00:14:01,360 --> 00:14:06,240
outdoors. Basically, nobody has these

357
00:14:04,160 --> 00:14:08,480
and almost all of them are really old

358
00:14:06,240 --> 00:14:11,040
and the cantens are just not in usable

359
00:14:08,480 --> 00:14:13,120
shape. So, getting a fresh run of them

360
00:14:11,040 --> 00:14:15,199
is a real benefit to us in the outdoor

361
00:14:13,120 --> 00:14:17,680
world. Mr. Dyer is trying to get at

362
00:14:15,199 --> 00:14:19,440
least 500 people to sign on for this so

363
00:14:17,680 --> 00:14:21,440
it can make it economically viable to

364
00:14:19,440 --> 00:14:22,959
actually reproduce. And if he gets

365
00:14:21,440 --> 00:14:25,920
enough of those, then we're going to go

366
00:14:22,959 --> 00:14:27,600
into production, charge the rate, and it

367
00:14:25,920 --> 00:14:29,360
could take up to a year to get these

368
00:14:27,600 --> 00:14:31,279
reproduced, but it's likely going to be

369
00:14:29,360 --> 00:14:33,279
a lot sooner. Again, it just depends on

370
00:14:31,279 --> 00:14:35,040
the market and what happens and and how

371
00:14:33,279 --> 00:14:36,720
backed up the factory is and all of that

372
00:14:35,040 --> 00:14:39,279
that's actually reproducing this in the

373
00:14:36,720 --> 00:14:40,959
318 stainless steel. However, because

374
00:14:39,279 --> 00:14:43,199
Mr. Dyer will have your contact

375
00:14:40,959 --> 00:14:45,760
information, he's going to keep us all a

376
00:14:43,199 --> 00:14:47,839
breast of the progress as this is

377
00:14:45,760 --> 00:14:49,600
produced all the way down to shipping

378
00:14:47,839 --> 00:14:51,920
them out. So, I'm really looking forward

379
00:14:49,600 --> 00:14:54,079
to this and as a matter of fact, I am

380
00:14:51,920 --> 00:14:55,920
planning on getting one, of course, and

381
00:14:54,079 --> 00:14:58,000
I'm really looking forward to using it.

382
00:14:55,920 --> 00:15:00,160
I love these old kits. It looks great in

383
00:14:58,000 --> 00:15:02,000
my series, but because it is an antique

384
00:15:00,160 --> 00:15:04,320
and because they are rare, we have to be

385
00:15:02,000 --> 00:15:06,399
super careful with them. So, needless to

386
00:15:04,320 --> 00:15:08,240
say, I'm pretty pumped about getting a

387
00:15:06,399 --> 00:15:09,920
new one that I can actually take out and

388
00:15:08,240 --> 00:15:11,760
use in the woods. Well, folks, I hope

389
00:15:09,920 --> 00:15:14,639
you've enjoyed this video. Another fora

390
00:15:11,760 --> 00:15:17,279
into the past, another one in our series

391
00:15:14,639 --> 00:15:19,519
of camping like Keepart. This is an

392
00:15:17,279 --> 00:15:20,720
amazing cook kit. I'm glad that I was

393
00:15:19,519 --> 00:15:23,040
able to get a hold of one of the

394
00:15:20,720 --> 00:15:24,639
originals, but again, as I said before,

395
00:15:23,040 --> 00:15:27,120
I'm really excited to get the

396
00:15:24,639 --> 00:15:29,279
reproduction rolling. So, help me get

397
00:15:27,120 --> 00:15:30,959
down there, click on those sites, sign

398
00:15:29,279 --> 00:15:33,040
up for this. Let's get this thing back

399
00:15:30,959 --> 00:15:34,720
into production. This is James Bender
