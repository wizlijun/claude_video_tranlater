00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,830
hi this is richard from original

2
00:00:01,589 --> 00:00:09,919
outdoors this is our 2018 updated guide

3
00:00:04,830 --> 00:00:09,919
to UK knife laws for an outdoor context

4
00:00:12,830 --> 00:00:18,270
so we've got a few things to look at

5
00:00:16,049 --> 00:00:21,270
here the first thing is that UK knife

6
00:00:18,270 --> 00:00:23,460
laws can be more than a bit weird to be

7
00:00:21,270 --> 00:00:25,800
honest they're quite restrictive in

8
00:00:23,460 --> 00:00:29,130
terms of what you can carry but also

9
00:00:25,800 --> 00:00:30,869
they're quite vague in the wording so I

10
00:00:29,130 --> 00:00:32,930
want to explain that but the best way to

11
00:00:30,869 --> 00:00:35,520
explain it is just to read it out I know

12
00:00:32,930 --> 00:00:36,600
I'm gonna do something more energetic

13
00:00:35,520 --> 00:00:39,300
than that in a bit don't worry

14
00:00:36,600 --> 00:00:41,879
so basic laws are knives it's illegal to

15
00:00:39,300 --> 00:00:44,629
sell a knife to anyone under 18 unless

16
00:00:41,879 --> 00:00:47,700
it has a folding blade three inches long

17
00:00:44,629 --> 00:00:49,980
7.62 centimetres or less it is illegal

18
00:00:47,700 --> 00:00:50,399
to carry a knife in public without good

19
00:00:49,980 --> 00:00:52,440
reason

20
00:00:50,399 --> 00:00:54,360
unless it has a folding blade with a

21
00:00:52,440 --> 00:00:57,090
cutting edge three inches long or less

22
00:00:54,360 --> 00:00:59,010
carry buy or sell any type of banned

23
00:00:57,090 --> 00:01:02,670
knife use any knife in a threatening way

24
00:00:59,010 --> 00:01:03,960
you need an illegal knife in Scotland 16

25
00:01:02,670 --> 00:01:06,210
to 18 year-olds are allowed to buy

26
00:01:03,960 --> 00:01:08,040
cutlery and kitchen knives lock knives

27
00:01:06,210 --> 00:01:09,450
are not classed as folding knives and

28
00:01:08,040 --> 00:01:12,119
are illegal to carry in public without

29
00:01:09,450 --> 00:01:13,770
good reason lock knives have blades that

30
00:01:12,119 --> 00:01:16,110
can be locked and refolded only by

31
00:01:13,770 --> 00:01:18,479
pressing a button can include multi-tool

32
00:01:16,110 --> 00:01:19,650
multi-tool knives tools that also

33
00:01:18,479 --> 00:01:22,020
contain other devices such as

34
00:01:19,650 --> 00:01:24,509
screwdriver or can opener van nuys in

35
00:01:22,020 --> 00:01:26,130
the UK it's illegal to bring into the UK

36
00:01:24,509 --> 00:01:28,950
cell hire lend or give anyone the

37
00:01:26,130 --> 00:01:31,439
following butterfly knives the fancy

38
00:01:28,950 --> 00:01:35,880
flippy faulty ones disguise knives so

39
00:01:31,439 --> 00:01:39,210
things like a knife disguise in a belt

40
00:01:35,880 --> 00:01:40,350
buckle or lipstick thing that's got a

41
00:01:39,210 --> 00:01:42,329
knife in it or something like that

42
00:01:40,350 --> 00:01:44,310
flick knives or switch blades or

43
00:01:42,329 --> 00:01:47,009
automatic knives gravity knives stealth

44
00:01:44,310 --> 00:01:50,430
knives so a knife or spike not made from

45
00:01:47,009 --> 00:01:51,810
metal so ceramic knives and zombie

46
00:01:50,430 --> 00:01:53,759
knives and 9 for the cutting edge a

47
00:01:51,810 --> 00:01:56,060
serrated edge and images are worth

48
00:01:53,759 --> 00:02:00,979
suggesting it is used for violence

49
00:01:56,060 --> 00:02:03,649
knuckle dusters quite a long list

50
00:02:00,979 --> 00:02:05,509
with an outdoor context though most of

51
00:02:03,649 --> 00:02:07,850
that doesn't apply the second bit of

52
00:02:05,509 --> 00:02:10,670
abandoned weapons part but the first bit

53
00:02:07,850 --> 00:02:12,410
you've read need to be aware of so I

54
00:02:10,670 --> 00:02:16,640
have five knives in front of me

55
00:02:12,410 --> 00:02:19,040
which I carry for my work and have all

56
00:02:16,640 --> 00:02:22,239
been carried in a public place in some

57
00:02:19,040 --> 00:02:23,569
way so the breakpoint is actually here

58
00:02:22,239 --> 00:02:27,170
everything

59
00:02:23,569 --> 00:02:29,180
that side of the line means something

60
00:02:27,170 --> 00:02:33,440
everything that's out of line means

61
00:02:29,180 --> 00:02:36,049
something else this is a Victorinox well

62
00:02:33,440 --> 00:02:38,420
it's a Swiss Army knife it has a folding

63
00:02:36,049 --> 00:02:40,190
non locking blade you just press on the

64
00:02:38,420 --> 00:02:43,220
back and it closes it's sharp its

65
00:02:40,190 --> 00:02:46,160
razor-sharp shaving sharp like well most

66
00:02:43,220 --> 00:02:48,560
of my regular cutting tools but that's

67
00:02:46,160 --> 00:02:51,680
it it has a small blade here as well

68
00:02:48,560 --> 00:02:53,590
which I never really use and it's got

69
00:02:51,680 --> 00:02:56,750
the usual screwdriver can opener

70
00:02:53,590 --> 00:02:59,239
corkscrew tweezers and a toothpick that

71
00:02:56,750 --> 00:03:01,459
kind of thing that's a folding non

72
00:02:59,239 --> 00:03:05,480
locking blade of less than three inches

73
00:03:01,459 --> 00:03:07,760
this is a handmade sheath knife it's

74
00:03:05,480 --> 00:03:11,750
quite long blade this was made for me by

75
00:03:07,760 --> 00:03:14,480
a friend to meet my huge hands and it's

76
00:03:11,750 --> 00:03:16,310
a knife I use most weeks with clients of

77
00:03:14,480 --> 00:03:19,250
one type or another and out here in the

78
00:03:16,310 --> 00:03:22,310
woods and on a few other things this is

79
00:03:19,250 --> 00:03:24,290
a getting on a bit now gerber multi-tool

80
00:03:22,310 --> 00:03:26,000
that i've had to repair and fix the

81
00:03:24,290 --> 00:03:27,350
screws on several times the belt clip

82
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:29,750
doesn't work has all the usual

83
00:03:27,350 --> 00:03:31,760
multi-tool bits including and not very

84
00:03:29,750 --> 00:03:34,040
long but folding locking blade there's a

85
00:03:31,760 --> 00:03:36,079
small button I have to press there to

86
00:03:34,040 --> 00:03:37,940
close it and open l one of these weird

87
00:03:36,079 --> 00:03:40,280
ones where they've died the handle green

88
00:03:37,940 --> 00:03:44,709
folding it locks with a rotating collar

89
00:03:40,280 --> 00:03:47,989
not a button which is a locking blade

90
00:03:44,709 --> 00:03:50,000
there's debate about whether that class

91
00:03:47,989 --> 00:03:53,870
the same as other locking knives and

92
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:56,120
this Magnum Boca Boca I don't know it

93
00:03:53,870 --> 00:03:57,470
was a cheap knife but I actually had

94
00:03:56,120 --> 00:03:58,849
this as part of my regular mountain

95
00:03:57,470 --> 00:04:02,359
rescue kids I had two knives that I

96
00:03:58,849 --> 00:04:03,799
carried one was a Gerber folding rope

97
00:04:02,359 --> 00:04:06,290
rescue knife which has a completely

98
00:04:03,799 --> 00:04:08,269
blunt tip and very aggressive serrated

99
00:04:06,290 --> 00:04:10,760
edges in a folding locking blade that

100
00:04:08,269 --> 00:04:13,120
was with my rope kit and then this which

101
00:04:10,760 --> 00:04:14,900
actually lived on most the time on my

102
00:04:13,120 --> 00:04:17,690
radio chest harness

103
00:04:14,900 --> 00:04:19,220
have a chess rig with a VHF radio and

104
00:04:17,690 --> 00:04:21,049
torch and a few other things and then

105
00:04:19,220 --> 00:04:23,780
airwaves SATA thought was carrying one

106
00:04:21,049 --> 00:04:25,729
and then that was tucked into it this is

107
00:04:23,780 --> 00:04:27,979
a folding locking blade with a slight

108
00:04:25,729 --> 00:04:29,630
curve quite a solid blade can be used

109
00:04:27,979 --> 00:04:33,560
one-handed quite easily there's a clip

110
00:04:29,630 --> 00:04:35,479
to hold it and a seatbelt cutter and one

111
00:04:33,560 --> 00:04:37,669
of those hard and presto so you could

112
00:04:35,479 --> 00:04:40,400
use it to break glass to be honest in

113
00:04:37,669 --> 00:04:42,770
rescue terms it was more often used for

114
00:04:40,400 --> 00:04:43,130
getting into cable ties and that kind of

115
00:04:42,770 --> 00:04:45,169
thing

116
00:04:43,130 --> 00:04:47,060
including loaning it to a police officer

117
00:04:45,169 --> 00:04:48,889
so they could cut into their own

118
00:04:47,060 --> 00:04:50,810
equipment to get something out because

119
00:04:48,889 --> 00:04:52,460
they weren't carrying a knife five

120
00:04:50,810 --> 00:04:53,900
knives that I regularly carry I have

121
00:04:52,460 --> 00:04:56,479
other knives I have wood carving knives

122
00:04:53,900 --> 00:04:59,539
or spoon gouges and all sorts of axes

123
00:04:56,479 --> 00:05:02,539
and things but this covers most of the

124
00:04:59,539 --> 00:05:07,190
common uses so that's the break point

125
00:05:02,539 --> 00:05:09,949
there as I read out anything more than

126
00:05:07,190 --> 00:05:11,810
that anything more than a folding

127
00:05:09,949 --> 00:05:14,419
non-locking blade with an edge of less

128
00:05:11,810 --> 00:05:16,639
than three inches I have to have a good

129
00:05:14,419 --> 00:05:18,860
reason as to why I'm carrying it so all

130
00:05:16,639 --> 00:05:20,840
of these here from carrying them in a

131
00:05:18,860 --> 00:05:24,590
public place I need to have a good

132
00:05:20,840 --> 00:05:27,050
reason as to why I have them this as

133
00:05:24,590 --> 00:05:29,330
long as I'm not using it as a weapon as

134
00:05:27,050 --> 00:05:31,610
long as I'm not using it in a way that

135
00:05:29,330 --> 00:05:34,250
can cause alarm or distress to a member

136
00:05:31,610 --> 00:05:36,349
of the public as long as I'm not it can

137
00:05:34,250 --> 00:05:39,650
t be perceived as a weapon then it's up

138
00:05:36,349 --> 00:05:41,510
to a police officer and never do end up

139
00:05:39,650 --> 00:05:43,699
being arrested for carrying that someone

140
00:05:41,510 --> 00:05:46,400
else and the CPS and the courts and

141
00:05:43,699 --> 00:05:48,430
whoever it is down the line to tell me

142
00:05:46,400 --> 00:05:50,900
and to prove why I can't carry that

143
00:05:48,430 --> 00:05:54,260
however it the onus is on me the

144
00:05:50,900 --> 00:05:57,849
pressure is on me to explain why I am

145
00:05:54,260 --> 00:06:00,380
carrying those in that location so

146
00:05:57,849 --> 00:06:02,690
mastering rescues knife well I could

147
00:06:00,380 --> 00:06:04,159
explain why I had it I could explain why

148
00:06:02,690 --> 00:06:05,949
I had it as I handed it to the police

149
00:06:04,159 --> 00:06:09,080
officer because they didn't have a knife

150
00:06:05,949 --> 00:06:11,090
the opinel well it's light and it's

151
00:06:09,080 --> 00:06:13,550
really quite sharp and it's a perfect

152
00:06:11,090 --> 00:06:15,680
sort of skinning cutting knife a very

153
00:06:13,550 --> 00:06:18,830
small game and it's just a nice

154
00:06:15,680 --> 00:06:21,620
lightweight knife the multi-tool well

155
00:06:18,830 --> 00:06:23,150
it's just very very useful as you can

156
00:06:21,620 --> 00:06:24,409
see how battered and scratch this one is

157
00:06:23,150 --> 00:06:26,570
this gets used a lot

158
00:06:24,409 --> 00:06:28,790
I've used it to repair the car of use it

159
00:06:26,570 --> 00:06:30,620
to fix for photographic equipment and

160
00:06:28,790 --> 00:06:32,840
under there's little grub screws on

161
00:06:30,620 --> 00:06:34,700
tripods and things and the mechanical

162
00:06:32,840 --> 00:06:36,380
advantage of those pliers is well it's

163
00:06:34,700 --> 00:06:38,510
difficult to get past being able to cut

164
00:06:36,380 --> 00:06:40,820
through wire with it it's all very

165
00:06:38,510 --> 00:06:42,830
useful and having a cutting tool there

166
00:06:40,820 --> 00:06:44,990
is very useful too and then a fixed

167
00:06:42,830 --> 00:06:46,220
blade knife well it does something that

168
00:06:44,990 --> 00:06:48,290
the others can't and that's give you

169
00:06:46,220 --> 00:06:50,570
confidence that it's not going to close

170
00:06:48,290 --> 00:06:53,720
onto your fingers and cut into tendons

171
00:06:50,570 --> 00:06:55,970
and give you a life-changing injury so a

172
00:06:53,720 --> 00:06:57,770
fixed blade knife is perfect for wood

173
00:06:55,970 --> 00:07:01,040
carving doing some serious cutting work

174
00:06:57,770 --> 00:07:03,530
and skinning and preparing large gang I

175
00:07:01,040 --> 00:07:06,980
can explain why I have those when I'm

176
00:07:03,530 --> 00:07:11,630
using them but I would need a good

177
00:07:06,980 --> 00:07:13,610
reason to carry them just because well I

178
00:07:11,630 --> 00:07:14,840
was out walking yesterday and these are

179
00:07:13,610 --> 00:07:17,540
the same trousers and it's still in my

180
00:07:14,840 --> 00:07:19,580
pocket now when I'm in Tesco or the pub

181
00:07:17,540 --> 00:07:22,130
or whatever but that's not a good reason

182
00:07:19,580 --> 00:07:24,830
laziness is not a defense the same goes

183
00:07:22,130 --> 00:07:26,300
for all of these just having them oh

184
00:07:24,830 --> 00:07:29,240
it's always in my kit and it's always

185
00:07:26,300 --> 00:07:32,210
there isn't a good reason my mountain

186
00:07:29,240 --> 00:07:34,670
rescue knife and that was used if I

187
00:07:32,210 --> 00:07:35,990
lived with my radio chest harness and it

188
00:07:34,670 --> 00:07:38,300
came back into the house to charge the

189
00:07:35,990 --> 00:07:39,860
radios and it was next to my mount and

190
00:07:38,300 --> 00:07:41,300
rescue equipment and it lived in the

191
00:07:39,860 --> 00:07:43,010
back of the car but it was always locked

192
00:07:41,300 --> 00:07:45,140
in the boot and it was never really on

193
00:07:43,010 --> 00:07:46,460
display and it just lived there like the

194
00:07:45,140 --> 00:07:49,010
rest of my rescue equipment

195
00:07:46,460 --> 00:07:52,190
I didn't wander around in the

196
00:07:49,010 --> 00:07:54,530
supermarket or in the pub wearing that

197
00:07:52,190 --> 00:07:56,480
because well I'd look like an idiot but

198
00:07:54,530 --> 00:07:59,300
also I wouldn't have a good reason for

199
00:07:56,480 --> 00:08:01,700
doing it same goes for that same goes

200
00:07:59,300 --> 00:08:03,500
for that knife I need to have a good

201
00:08:01,700 --> 00:08:05,270
reason for why I'm carrying them so if

202
00:08:03,500 --> 00:08:06,830
I'm walking in the mountains I wouldn't

203
00:08:05,270 --> 00:08:09,200
really carry something like this because

204
00:08:06,830 --> 00:08:12,110
it's big and heavy and there's nothing

205
00:08:09,200 --> 00:08:13,370
I'm gonna cut but I need all that kind

206
00:08:12,110 --> 00:08:15,320
of cutting power and that kind of

207
00:08:13,370 --> 00:08:18,770
confidence I'd carry something like that

208
00:08:15,320 --> 00:08:20,930
or that or even maps but if it needed a

209
00:08:18,770 --> 00:08:23,030
fixed blade or a locking blade for

210
00:08:20,930 --> 00:08:25,130
whatever thing I was doing then I'd

211
00:08:23,030 --> 00:08:27,620
carry something like that but I wouldn't

212
00:08:25,130 --> 00:08:29,750
just carry it and then still have it on

213
00:08:27,620 --> 00:08:31,970
my person several days later it goes out

214
00:08:29,750 --> 00:08:34,340
with my walking kit on my mountaineering

215
00:08:31,970 --> 00:08:35,810
kit and it lives in the rucksack it

216
00:08:34,340 --> 00:08:38,570
doesn't live in my pocket generally and

217
00:08:35,810 --> 00:08:39,979
when I'm done with whatever I'm doing it

218
00:08:38,570 --> 00:08:40,910
goes back in the kit store on the shelf

219
00:08:39,979 --> 00:08:42,530
or

220
00:08:40,910 --> 00:08:45,290
in the corner of the living room or

221
00:08:42,530 --> 00:08:47,210
whatever else your kit lives it lives

222
00:08:45,290 --> 00:08:50,060
with it it's not something I generally

223
00:08:47,210 --> 00:08:51,860
carry if I need a day-to-day knife for

224
00:08:50,060 --> 00:08:53,240
small tasks and opening packets and

225
00:08:51,860 --> 00:08:55,700
cutting stringing and that kind of thing

226
00:08:53,240 --> 00:08:57,760
then that does the job and I'm legally

227
00:08:55,700 --> 00:09:00,340
allowed to carry that in the UK but

228
00:08:57,760 --> 00:09:03,470
that's the important break point

229
00:09:00,340 --> 00:09:06,080
anything more than a folding non locking

230
00:09:03,470 --> 00:09:08,390
blade of three inches up to you to

231
00:09:06,080 --> 00:09:10,370
justify why you've got it anything less

232
00:09:08,390 --> 00:09:11,830
than that and it's up to someone else to

233
00:09:10,370 --> 00:09:13,850
tell you why you shouldn't have that

234
00:09:11,830 --> 00:09:17,630
assuming you're not using it as a weapon

235
00:09:13,850 --> 00:09:19,430
or brandishing it or using it to say

236
00:09:17,630 --> 00:09:21,710
you're carrying it for self-defense or

237
00:09:19,430 --> 00:09:24,470
whatever reason that's outlined there

238
00:09:21,710 --> 00:09:27,790
there are some changes that are just

239
00:09:24,470 --> 00:09:30,650
about to come in around knives in the UK

240
00:09:27,790 --> 00:09:32,570
the a lot of it doesn't actually applies

241
00:09:30,650 --> 00:09:34,100
they're an outdoor context because the

242
00:09:32,570 --> 00:09:35,990
things that affect where you can carry

243
00:09:34,100 --> 00:09:39,290
things and what you can carry is

244
00:09:35,990 --> 00:09:42,080
remaining unchanged the big one really

245
00:09:39,290 --> 00:09:44,810
is that up until now you could order a

246
00:09:42,080 --> 00:09:47,480
knife online and there'll be no be some

247
00:09:44,810 --> 00:09:50,030
kind of age verification decoration but

248
00:09:47,480 --> 00:09:52,610
the criticism was that it wasn't being

249
00:09:50,030 --> 00:09:55,160
done properly before you could order a

250
00:09:52,610 --> 00:09:56,320
knife online and say you were over 18

251
00:09:55,160 --> 00:09:59,900
and have it sent to your home address

252
00:09:56,320 --> 00:10:01,640
and yeah that's just how how it would

253
00:09:59,900 --> 00:10:03,560
work what's changing is that you won't

254
00:10:01,640 --> 00:10:05,870
be allowed to sell knives to a home

255
00:10:03,560 --> 00:10:09,770
address it can only go to a business

256
00:10:05,870 --> 00:10:12,020
address so thinking behind that is I

257
00:10:09,770 --> 00:10:14,420
think that prevents people buying knives

258
00:10:12,020 --> 00:10:16,310
quietly and just getting them sent to

259
00:10:14,420 --> 00:10:19,460
their address anonymously under the age

260
00:10:16,310 --> 00:10:22,070
of 18 and then with only a knife without

261
00:10:19,460 --> 00:10:23,660
any much of a trail back to them but

262
00:10:22,070 --> 00:10:26,360
still allowing businesses to order

263
00:10:23,660 --> 00:10:28,430
knives for work and for resale but it

264
00:10:26,360 --> 00:10:30,470
will just kill the mail-order - home

265
00:10:28,430 --> 00:10:33,500
knife industry although what would

266
00:10:30,470 --> 00:10:35,240
probably happen and assuming that this

267
00:10:33,500 --> 00:10:36,740
is still allowed within the law that

268
00:10:35,240 --> 00:10:38,660
people would just get their knives that

269
00:10:36,740 --> 00:10:40,400
they buy online tend to work another

270
00:10:38,660 --> 00:10:43,010
change is that it's going to be illegal

271
00:10:40,400 --> 00:10:45,860
to carry a knife of any kind on a high

272
00:10:43,010 --> 00:10:46,819
risk higher education establishment or

273
00:10:45,860 --> 00:10:48,289
campus

274
00:10:46,819 --> 00:10:49,850
has been a case in schools but it's

275
00:10:48,289 --> 00:10:51,769
going to go to that there are a few of

276
00:10:49,850 --> 00:10:53,869
the changes around the definition of

277
00:10:51,769 --> 00:10:56,299
those illegal weapons and what's illegal

278
00:10:53,869 --> 00:10:58,819
to own and to to buy and that kind of

279
00:10:56,299 --> 00:11:01,039
thing but in an outdoor context is not

280
00:10:58,819 --> 00:11:03,049
actually changing that much the things

281
00:11:01,039 --> 00:11:07,249
that really do affect the outdoor

282
00:11:03,049 --> 00:11:08,809
recreation and professional user have

283
00:11:07,249 --> 00:11:11,179
been the case for a while and will

284
00:11:08,809 --> 00:11:12,979
remain the case folding non locking

285
00:11:11,179 --> 00:11:15,579
blade of less than three inches you can

286
00:11:12,979 --> 00:11:19,459
carry it in generally in a public place

287
00:11:15,579 --> 00:11:21,439
fixed blade locking blades it's up to

288
00:11:19,459 --> 00:11:24,139
you to have a good reason as why you're

289
00:11:21,439 --> 00:11:28,639
carrying that it's probably also worth

290
00:11:24,139 --> 00:11:30,379
thinking about what you're doing in

291
00:11:28,639 --> 00:11:33,379
terms of trespass and things like that

292
00:11:30,379 --> 00:11:35,989
because people while camp and go to find

293
00:11:33,379 --> 00:11:37,850
huge acres of woodland that they can't

294
00:11:35,989 --> 00:11:39,979
really find the landowner maybe go and

295
00:11:37,850 --> 00:11:42,259
have a sneaky overnight in a bitty bag

296
00:11:39,979 --> 00:11:45,679
there and there's the whole micro

297
00:11:42,259 --> 00:11:47,839
adventure thing and getting out of

298
00:11:45,679 --> 00:11:49,399
London and just going sleeping in a baby

299
00:11:47,839 --> 00:11:51,229
bag on the side of the South Downs or

300
00:11:49,399 --> 00:11:53,229
somewhere quietly not disturbing anybody

301
00:11:51,229 --> 00:11:55,549
not causing any problems the landowner

302
00:11:53,229 --> 00:11:57,159
doesn't know you're there and wouldn't

303
00:11:55,549 --> 00:11:59,569
know you have been there because you've

304
00:11:57,159 --> 00:12:01,909
you've followed the practices of Leave

305
00:11:59,569 --> 00:12:03,350
No Trace and you've not had a fire and

306
00:12:01,909 --> 00:12:03,739
you just quietly lay down slept for the

307
00:12:03,350 --> 00:12:05,239
night

308
00:12:03,739 --> 00:12:08,539
take it and photo as a sunrise and

309
00:12:05,239 --> 00:12:09,589
walked off again even though you don't

310
00:12:08,539 --> 00:12:11,509
have the right to camp there it's

311
00:12:09,589 --> 00:12:16,789
technically trespass trespass is just a

312
00:12:11,509 --> 00:12:20,869
civil offense but if you're carrying

313
00:12:16,789 --> 00:12:22,069
that does that make it armed trespass no

314
00:12:20,869 --> 00:12:24,889
doubt that we debate about that in the

315
00:12:22,069 --> 00:12:26,959
comments below and it depends on the

316
00:12:24,889 --> 00:12:28,819
case and whose land you're on and all

317
00:12:26,959 --> 00:12:29,959
those other things but you've got to

318
00:12:28,819 --> 00:12:33,019
think about these things in a wider

319
00:12:29,959 --> 00:12:35,329
context particularly as knives are being

320
00:12:33,019 --> 00:12:39,319
seen less and less by the general public

321
00:12:35,329 --> 00:12:40,639
as tools and more as well weapons knives

322
00:12:39,319 --> 00:12:43,249
because that's how they're being talked

323
00:12:40,639 --> 00:12:45,289
about by the media by politicians and by

324
00:12:43,249 --> 00:12:48,109
everyone else for me these knives are

325
00:12:45,289 --> 00:12:50,509
all tools they are five very useful

326
00:12:48,109 --> 00:12:52,159
tools to me and they are as useful as my

327
00:12:50,509 --> 00:12:54,259
rucksacks and my sleeping bags my tents

328
00:12:52,159 --> 00:12:56,329
and my ropes and my kayak and my canoe

329
00:12:54,259 --> 00:12:57,799
and my mountain bike my camera equipment

330
00:12:56,329 --> 00:13:00,089
my water proofs

331
00:12:57,799 --> 00:13:02,459
their tools their tools that can be

332
00:13:00,089 --> 00:13:04,069
misused and the tools that I need to

333
00:13:02,459 --> 00:13:08,009
take care of and they'll take care of me

334
00:13:04,069 --> 00:13:10,920
so that's the end of it really that's

335
00:13:08,009 --> 00:13:12,540
the end of the basics of UK knife law is

336
00:13:10,920 --> 00:13:15,180
not changing a great deal for an outdoor

337
00:13:12,540 --> 00:13:17,249
user but you should be aware of where

338
00:13:15,180 --> 00:13:18,990
that break point is between the folding

339
00:13:17,249 --> 00:13:21,269
non-locking blade of less than 3 inches

340
00:13:18,990 --> 00:13:23,819
and everything else why you have a good

341
00:13:21,269 --> 00:13:25,889
reason about carrying it so that's the

342
00:13:23,819 --> 00:13:28,019
end of the knife law section I'm going

343
00:13:25,889 --> 00:13:30,509
to go to the next bit which is my

344
00:13:28,019 --> 00:13:31,800
opinion on the whole thing so if you

345
00:13:30,509 --> 00:13:32,759
don't watch that you can turn off now

346
00:13:31,800 --> 00:13:34,499
thank you for watching

347
00:13:32,759 --> 00:13:37,139
but if I want to see my opinion then

348
00:13:34,499 --> 00:13:39,629
keep watching ok so that was a law bit

349
00:13:37,139 --> 00:13:42,870
this is my personal opinion because I

350
00:13:39,629 --> 00:13:44,490
don't really talk about in the tutorial

351
00:13:42,870 --> 00:13:46,499
videos you know we laugh and joke and

352
00:13:44,490 --> 00:13:49,529
say things but we don't I don't really

353
00:13:46,499 --> 00:13:51,809
talk about my views on political matters

354
00:13:49,529 --> 00:13:53,610
and cultural matters and other things

355
00:13:51,809 --> 00:13:55,559
but I think in this case it's

356
00:13:53,610 --> 00:13:57,240
appropriate to because well the last

357
00:13:55,559 --> 00:13:59,149
time this isn't the first video on

358
00:13:57,240 --> 00:14:01,559
knives that I've made for this channel

359
00:13:59,149 --> 00:14:04,290
the last time we made a video it was a

360
00:14:01,559 --> 00:14:05,790
short simple video very similar mine's

361
00:14:04,290 --> 00:14:07,980
on the table talking about can you carry

362
00:14:05,790 --> 00:14:11,579
this can you carry that and all sorts of

363
00:14:07,980 --> 00:14:14,579
things that video led to more comments

364
00:14:11,579 --> 00:14:19,259
on the channel than anything else we put

365
00:14:14,579 --> 00:14:22,170
online they look something like this and

366
00:14:19,259 --> 00:14:25,649
that video also led to people

367
00:14:22,170 --> 00:14:28,110
well contacted me at work because this

368
00:14:25,649 --> 00:14:29,730
is this is a YouTube channel but it's

369
00:14:28,110 --> 00:14:32,040
the YouTube channel of my business of

370
00:14:29,730 --> 00:14:33,809
original outdoors and run training

371
00:14:32,040 --> 00:14:35,579
courses and have clients and have an

372
00:14:33,809 --> 00:14:37,559
office and all sorts of things which are

373
00:14:35,579 --> 00:14:40,350
linked to from the channel the website

374
00:14:37,559 --> 00:14:43,259
is easy to find and I meet him a real

375
00:14:40,350 --> 00:14:45,179
name people were finding me at work and

376
00:14:43,259 --> 00:14:46,889
contacting work to not to discuss

377
00:14:45,179 --> 00:14:48,749
courses or to inquire about things but

378
00:14:46,889 --> 00:14:51,749
to discuss that video in particular

379
00:14:48,749 --> 00:14:53,220
because they for some reason disagreed

380
00:14:51,749 --> 00:14:54,449
with something in that and the video was

381
00:14:53,220 --> 00:14:56,550
pretty much the same we read out the

382
00:14:54,449 --> 00:14:58,290
laws talk about the knives fault in

383
00:14:56,550 --> 00:15:00,600
non-locking less than 3 inches that's

384
00:14:58,290 --> 00:15:03,540
about it but people feel very

385
00:15:00,600 --> 00:15:05,879
passionately about this subject and not

386
00:15:03,540 --> 00:15:08,629
only did they call work but they arrived

387
00:15:05,879 --> 00:15:11,189
there and arrived to the office which is

388
00:15:08,629 --> 00:15:12,899
interesting when somebody suddenly

389
00:15:11,189 --> 00:15:13,880
arrives at your place of work a complete

390
00:15:12,899 --> 00:15:15,410
stranger and once this

391
00:15:13,880 --> 00:15:18,290
their opinions on knives and

392
00:15:15,410 --> 00:15:20,930
self-defense with you that's a weird one

393
00:15:18,290 --> 00:15:24,260
so I want to address that in this video

394
00:15:20,930 --> 00:15:26,090
so there are various lives here the vat

395
00:15:24,260 --> 00:15:30,290
knives I use an outdoor setting and two

396
00:15:26,090 --> 00:15:32,930
others I grew up in a rural house and

397
00:15:30,290 --> 00:15:35,480
Rahl family and we had firearms in the

398
00:15:32,930 --> 00:15:38,150
house and we had firearms relatives

399
00:15:35,480 --> 00:15:40,880
houses and most of my family of owned

400
00:15:38,150 --> 00:15:44,090
guns and one type or another and were

401
00:15:40,880 --> 00:15:45,620
also serving police officers and worked

402
00:15:44,090 --> 00:15:48,470
within the law or the Armed Forces or

403
00:15:45,620 --> 00:15:51,800
various other things and were hunters

404
00:15:48,470 --> 00:15:55,280
and farmers and working outdoors and

405
00:15:51,800 --> 00:15:57,260
worked in the countryside and had their

406
00:15:55,280 --> 00:16:00,140
firearms there as a tool of their

407
00:15:57,260 --> 00:16:01,880
business or as a sporting tool they

408
00:16:00,140 --> 00:16:03,080
weren't really seen as weapons they

409
00:16:01,880 --> 00:16:05,570
weren't there for self-defense they were

410
00:16:03,080 --> 00:16:07,220
there as a tool but throughout the 80s

411
00:16:05,570 --> 00:16:09,560
and into the 90s various incidents

412
00:16:07,220 --> 00:16:12,830
happened and very tragic incidents that

413
00:16:09,560 --> 00:16:15,140
led to the UK laws on firearms changing

414
00:16:12,830 --> 00:16:16,370
so it went through the point so there

415
00:16:15,140 --> 00:16:19,340
were various amnesties at that time

416
00:16:16,370 --> 00:16:20,180
which my family then just did what

417
00:16:19,340 --> 00:16:22,220
everyone else did every other

418
00:16:20,180 --> 00:16:24,140
law-abiding firearms owner and just

419
00:16:22,220 --> 00:16:25,970
handing everything in because you didn't

420
00:16:24,140 --> 00:16:28,330
really have much of a choice because the

421
00:16:25,970 --> 00:16:31,310
penalties for not doing so was so high

422
00:16:28,330 --> 00:16:34,700
that's that was it so that's what

423
00:16:31,310 --> 00:16:37,460
changed and alongside all that we've

424
00:16:34,700 --> 00:16:39,140
used knives we use cutting tools in the

425
00:16:37,460 --> 00:16:41,690
same way that I do every day now and

426
00:16:39,140 --> 00:16:43,460
that no doubt my children will if they

427
00:16:41,690 --> 00:16:47,690
follow me into this career or doing

428
00:16:43,460 --> 00:16:50,590
something similar to it so knives are

429
00:16:47,690 --> 00:16:53,930
part of my everyday life but it's also

430
00:16:50,590 --> 00:16:55,240
part of other people's lives everyday

431
00:16:53,930 --> 00:16:58,940
for different reasons

432
00:16:55,240 --> 00:17:01,070
you can't argue that the knife crimes

433
00:16:58,940 --> 00:17:04,670
and violent crimes involving knives has

434
00:17:01,070 --> 00:17:07,480
gone up in the UK in the last in a

435
00:17:04,670 --> 00:17:12,110
recent period mostly around London

436
00:17:07,480 --> 00:17:14,120
mostly or other large urban areas in the

437
00:17:12,110 --> 00:17:16,010
UK and I think knife crime in rural

438
00:17:14,120 --> 00:17:17,780
areas like this actually increased that

439
00:17:16,010 --> 00:17:19,150
much and it's the definition of that

440
00:17:17,780 --> 00:17:21,380
live crime it's not necessarily people

441
00:17:19,150 --> 00:17:22,550
stabbing each other or threatening each

442
00:17:21,380 --> 00:17:25,670
other or cutting each other

443
00:17:22,550 --> 00:17:26,480
it could be someone illegally carrying a

444
00:17:25,670 --> 00:17:28,220
knife

445
00:17:26,480 --> 00:17:31,940
or not having a good reason for carrying

446
00:17:28,220 --> 00:17:33,440
a lock knife in a public place as part

447
00:17:31,940 --> 00:17:35,210
of another crime they were committing I

448
00:17:33,440 --> 00:17:38,270
mean that when you look at the

449
00:17:35,210 --> 00:17:39,440
statistics if you take out those kind of

450
00:17:38,270 --> 00:17:41,720
things where some woman was in

451
00:17:39,440 --> 00:17:43,520
possession of an offensive weapon or a

452
00:17:41,720 --> 00:17:44,419
legal knife because they didn't have a

453
00:17:43,520 --> 00:17:47,150
good reason for it

454
00:17:44,419 --> 00:17:48,590
then that drops the crime rate and the

455
00:17:47,150 --> 00:17:51,620
perceived crime rate down quite a bit

456
00:17:48,590 --> 00:17:55,520
but I can't argue that those those

457
00:17:51,620 --> 00:17:57,710
figures those numbers have gone up and I

458
00:17:55,520 --> 00:18:00,140
live in a rural area I live somewhere

459
00:17:57,710 --> 00:18:01,520
without streetlights and where you can

460
00:18:00,140 --> 00:18:05,090
walk outside at night and all you can

461
00:18:01,520 --> 00:18:07,460
see is stars I live in a completely

462
00:18:05,090 --> 00:18:09,290
different place to London in two big

463
00:18:07,460 --> 00:18:10,429
urban areas so I don't have much

464
00:18:09,290 --> 00:18:11,450
experience of what it's like living

465
00:18:10,429 --> 00:18:17,450
there

466
00:18:11,450 --> 00:18:21,260
I carry knives for work legally but I

467
00:18:17,450 --> 00:18:25,390
don't think the way that knives are

468
00:18:21,260 --> 00:18:25,390
portrayed in the media and the news and

469
00:18:25,510 --> 00:18:30,710
the discussion about knives from more

470
00:18:28,760 --> 00:18:32,210
mostly driven by people who live and

471
00:18:30,710 --> 00:18:34,700
work in towns because that's what most

472
00:18:32,210 --> 00:18:36,890
people do live and work if you're not

473
00:18:34,700 --> 00:18:38,540
used to knives if you're not used to

474
00:18:36,890 --> 00:18:41,330
carrying knives as a tool for everyday

475
00:18:38,540 --> 00:18:42,410
use in an outdoor context and talk to

476
00:18:41,330 --> 00:18:43,340
most the farmers around here they'll

477
00:18:42,410 --> 00:18:45,710
have something like that

478
00:18:43,340 --> 00:18:47,510
in their pocket I mean some of the

479
00:18:45,710 --> 00:18:48,860
farmers I know they're probably carrying

480
00:18:47,510 --> 00:18:50,270
it for the day the accent I get their

481
00:18:48,860 --> 00:18:52,280
arm trapped in the baler and they've got

482
00:18:50,270 --> 00:18:56,570
to cut it off by hand that's what the

483
00:18:52,280 --> 00:18:59,450
like around here the most if you're not

484
00:18:56,570 --> 00:19:01,730
useful working with knives and melt as a

485
00:18:59,450 --> 00:19:05,540
tool if your only experience with knives

486
00:19:01,730 --> 00:19:07,370
are either the quite scary stories

487
00:19:05,540 --> 00:19:10,309
coming in about knife crime on the rise

488
00:19:07,370 --> 00:19:11,750
and all these violent crimes and just as

489
00:19:10,309 --> 00:19:13,220
something in your kitchen that lives

490
00:19:11,750 --> 00:19:18,049
next to your toaster and your chopping

491
00:19:13,220 --> 00:19:19,790
boards then something like that can be

492
00:19:18,049 --> 00:19:21,950
seated being quite scary and I've had

493
00:19:19,790 --> 00:19:23,740
this on courses and some media things

494
00:19:21,950 --> 00:19:26,750
when I've been doing some work on TV

495
00:19:23,740 --> 00:19:28,940
where I've said only the knife for that

496
00:19:26,750 --> 00:19:30,650
and I pulled the knife out and once had

497
00:19:28,940 --> 00:19:32,419
to produce the sort of rock back in

498
00:19:30,650 --> 00:19:34,010
shock he said that's illegal you can't

499
00:19:32,419 --> 00:19:36,620
carry that and actually explain - yeah

500
00:19:34,010 --> 00:19:39,050
yeah in this context I can

501
00:19:36,620 --> 00:19:42,140
if you're not used to seeing knives then

502
00:19:39,050 --> 00:19:47,240
any knife is a potentially scary thing

503
00:19:42,140 --> 00:19:50,570
and I think rather than educating people

504
00:19:47,240 --> 00:19:53,210
that some knives are tools and that's

505
00:19:50,570 --> 00:19:54,980
rather than restricting access to knives

506
00:19:53,210 --> 00:19:56,690
and the way you can get them and the

507
00:19:54,980 --> 00:19:57,950
changes and how they're delivered and

508
00:19:56,690 --> 00:20:00,070
you can't have them delivered to your

509
00:19:57,950 --> 00:20:02,210
house and zero tolerance and every other

510
00:20:00,070 --> 00:20:04,730
emotive thing that people say about

511
00:20:02,210 --> 00:20:07,940
knives in the UK at the moment rather

512
00:20:04,730 --> 00:20:10,220
than restricting that access and making

513
00:20:07,940 --> 00:20:12,650
everything into a weapon or to be seen

514
00:20:10,220 --> 00:20:14,810
as a weapon I think what we should be

515
00:20:12,650 --> 00:20:16,790
doing instead is addressing why people

516
00:20:14,810 --> 00:20:19,490
are carrying knives as weapons

517
00:20:16,790 --> 00:20:22,100
this tiny minority that are carrying

518
00:20:19,490 --> 00:20:24,080
knives why are they doing that why they

519
00:20:22,100 --> 00:20:26,330
so afraid that they feel they need a

520
00:20:24,080 --> 00:20:28,250
knife as a self-defense item because

521
00:20:26,330 --> 00:20:31,610
well talk to anyone who does stuff in

522
00:20:28,250 --> 00:20:33,680
self-defense and that kind of training a

523
00:20:31,610 --> 00:20:37,040
knife is a terrible weapon for

524
00:20:33,680 --> 00:20:38,810
self-defense anyway knife fighting and

525
00:20:37,040 --> 00:20:40,130
it doesn't work like it does in films if

526
00:20:38,810 --> 00:20:41,360
you're carrying a knife for self defense

527
00:20:40,130 --> 00:20:42,970
against someone else with a knife you're

528
00:20:41,360 --> 00:20:46,670
both gonna end up being cousin stabbed

529
00:20:42,970 --> 00:20:48,530
it's not gonna go well so and life is a

530
00:20:46,670 --> 00:20:53,030
terrible weapon for self-defense anyway

531
00:20:48,530 --> 00:20:54,470
and if you're carrying it it's not the

532
00:20:53,030 --> 00:20:56,000
item you're carrying this a problem it's

533
00:20:54,470 --> 00:20:57,470
your motivation for doing it it's your

534
00:20:56,000 --> 00:20:59,860
if you're carrying it for self-defense

535
00:20:57,470 --> 00:21:02,960
or to harm someone else well tackle why

536
00:20:59,860 --> 00:21:04,280
that person feels a need to defend

537
00:21:02,960 --> 00:21:05,870
themselves in that way why they feel

538
00:21:04,280 --> 00:21:06,920
afraid enough that something could

539
00:21:05,870 --> 00:21:08,990
happen that they need to defend

540
00:21:06,920 --> 00:21:10,490
themselves or that they want to attack

541
00:21:08,990 --> 00:21:12,800
someone else

542
00:21:10,490 --> 00:21:15,110
I think violent tendencies are part of

543
00:21:12,800 --> 00:21:17,120
human nature but so are many other

544
00:21:15,110 --> 00:21:20,090
things and we've managed to create a

545
00:21:17,120 --> 00:21:22,880
society where we can overcome a lot of

546
00:21:20,090 --> 00:21:26,900
those tendencies throw through rule of

547
00:21:22,880 --> 00:21:28,940
law tackling the reasons why people want

548
00:21:26,900 --> 00:21:31,580
to carry knives isn't easy and I don't

549
00:21:28,940 --> 00:21:33,680
really have any quick answers but I

550
00:21:31,580 --> 00:21:37,340
suspect it takes longer than the average

551
00:21:33,680 --> 00:21:39,650
election cycle and it takes longer much

552
00:21:37,340 --> 00:21:43,100
much longer than the well the several

553
00:21:39,650 --> 00:21:45,200
hours that is a new cycle now people

554
00:21:43,100 --> 00:21:46,790
want responses from the police from

555
00:21:45,200 --> 00:21:50,090
politicians

556
00:21:46,790 --> 00:21:55,040
and from the people that we elect and

557
00:21:50,090 --> 00:21:56,929
have to make decisions for us people

558
00:21:55,040 --> 00:21:58,910
demand responses from them and they want

559
00:21:56,929 --> 00:22:00,650
responses to a perceived problem quite

560
00:21:58,910 --> 00:22:02,600
quickly if you say right we're gonna

561
00:22:00,650 --> 00:22:04,190
tackle the problems in this community or

562
00:22:02,600 --> 00:22:05,990
as a as a nation as a whole that we

563
00:22:04,190 --> 00:22:08,150
think we have and it's going to take 25

564
00:22:05,990 --> 00:22:10,190
years no one's really going to vote for

565
00:22:08,150 --> 00:22:12,559
that or that's not going to survive

566
00:22:10,190 --> 00:22:15,080
beyond the next election because most

567
00:22:12,559 --> 00:22:17,059
long-term plans don't people want to be

568
00:22:15,080 --> 00:22:19,370
able to feel like they're had a response

569
00:22:17,059 --> 00:22:22,309
to a problem quite quickly and

570
00:22:19,370 --> 00:22:23,600
politicians whether through desire or

571
00:22:22,309 --> 00:22:27,500
just because that's the world they have

572
00:22:23,600 --> 00:22:29,450
to work in have to respond to well quick

573
00:22:27,500 --> 00:22:31,429
quick questions with quick answers and

574
00:22:29,450 --> 00:22:33,200
they have to feel like they have to show

575
00:22:31,429 --> 00:22:35,210
that they've done something and I think

576
00:22:33,200 --> 00:22:37,130
that the changes in UK knife law aren't

577
00:22:35,210 --> 00:22:38,450
gonna make it much of a difference where

578
00:22:37,130 --> 00:22:40,250
there is a problem with violent life

579
00:22:38,450 --> 00:22:43,460
crime but it is going to affect people

580
00:22:40,250 --> 00:22:45,799
who knife makers and people who buy

581
00:22:43,460 --> 00:22:46,910
knives and buy well this was from a

582
00:22:45,799 --> 00:22:49,010
friend and I went to his house to

583
00:22:46,910 --> 00:22:50,900
collect this after he made it for me but

584
00:22:49,010 --> 00:22:53,440
if I'd bought a knife from Ben or food

585
00:22:50,900 --> 00:22:55,880
or one of the other many fantastic

586
00:22:53,440 --> 00:22:58,309
craftspeople we have making knives here

587
00:22:55,880 --> 00:22:59,960
in the UK I'd have had to have that

588
00:22:58,309 --> 00:23:02,419
delivered to my office address not my

589
00:22:59,960 --> 00:23:04,059
home address it just added a step in

590
00:23:02,419 --> 00:23:07,160
there that was an inconvenience to me

591
00:23:04,059 --> 00:23:08,780
and could potentially reduce the number

592
00:23:07,160 --> 00:23:10,840
of sales for the crafts person who's

593
00:23:08,780 --> 00:23:14,230
built a successful small business

594
00:23:10,840 --> 00:23:17,900
providing income back into the economy

595
00:23:14,230 --> 00:23:21,260
around their craft it might reduce their

596
00:23:17,900 --> 00:23:23,330
sales as well so the changes in the law

597
00:23:21,260 --> 00:23:25,820
are going to affect people like that and

598
00:23:23,330 --> 00:23:27,559
people who buy knives for outdoor

599
00:23:25,820 --> 00:23:29,210
recreation and for work and people who

600
00:23:27,559 --> 00:23:30,919
sell them as part of their business I

601
00:23:29,210 --> 00:23:33,830
don't think it's going to affect people

602
00:23:30,919 --> 00:23:35,990
in well people who are committing

603
00:23:33,830 --> 00:23:38,360
violent crime because rather than buying

604
00:23:35,990 --> 00:23:40,490
a weird zombie killer knife or something

605
00:23:38,360 --> 00:23:41,960
else they're probably just going to keep

606
00:23:40,490 --> 00:23:43,549
using stuff like this which is a kitchen

607
00:23:41,960 --> 00:23:44,900
knife this is one of my knives from home

608
00:23:43,549 --> 00:23:46,820
it's not even a very good knife these

609
00:23:44,900 --> 00:23:48,980
are my good knives not allowed to take

610
00:23:46,820 --> 00:23:51,200
those out of the house apparently this

611
00:23:48,980 --> 00:23:53,179
is the cheap set of knives I think the

612
00:23:51,200 --> 00:23:55,400
whole knife block cost less than 10

613
00:23:53,179 --> 00:23:56,990
pounds and the front of supermarket and

614
00:23:55,400 --> 00:23:58,850
they're good backup knives for doing

615
00:23:56,990 --> 00:23:59,930
things that I don't want to put my

616
00:23:58,850 --> 00:24:01,910
nicely

617
00:23:59,930 --> 00:24:04,210
it's dropped and honed knives anywhere

618
00:24:01,910 --> 00:24:07,160
near but of all the knives on this table

619
00:24:04,210 --> 00:24:09,590
if we want to be if the one I would want

620
00:24:07,160 --> 00:24:12,890
to be stabbed by the least is that one

621
00:24:09,590 --> 00:24:14,510
the cheapest one here it's a fixed blade

622
00:24:12,890 --> 00:24:17,180
knife I don't have a good reason for

623
00:24:14,510 --> 00:24:18,970
carrying it but I'm guessing that you

624
00:24:17,180 --> 00:24:21,290
have something similar to that at home

625
00:24:18,970 --> 00:24:24,230
it's cheap steel is very cheap steel

626
00:24:21,290 --> 00:24:26,000
very cheap mass-produced produce but

627
00:24:24,230 --> 00:24:27,860
being stabbed like that well that's

628
00:24:26,000 --> 00:24:29,540
gonna give you a very large wound and it

629
00:24:27,860 --> 00:24:31,430
goes in a long way

630
00:24:29,540 --> 00:24:36,620
pretty much goes from one side of me to

631
00:24:31,430 --> 00:24:38,330
the other you still can't get that sent

632
00:24:36,620 --> 00:24:41,000
to a home address through mail order now

633
00:24:38,330 --> 00:24:42,860
but you could steal one from every

634
00:24:41,000 --> 00:24:45,710
kitchen I could also come under

635
00:24:42,860 --> 00:24:47,840
criticism for well I'm not living

636
00:24:45,710 --> 00:24:50,990
somewhere with an violent life crime

637
00:24:47,840 --> 00:24:53,450
issue and where do I have much right to

638
00:24:50,990 --> 00:24:56,180
discuss what's happening

639
00:24:53,450 --> 00:24:58,310
in London and other cities where life

640
00:24:56,180 --> 00:25:00,710
crime is potentially an issue do

641
00:24:58,310 --> 00:25:02,330
standing here in a remote woodland in

642
00:25:00,710 --> 00:25:04,880
North Wales where life crime isn't a

643
00:25:02,330 --> 00:25:06,230
problem sheep rustlers and sheep

644
00:25:04,880 --> 00:25:07,510
worrying is actually more of a problem

645
00:25:06,230 --> 00:25:10,370
here

646
00:25:07,510 --> 00:25:12,020
do I have much for right to talk about

647
00:25:10,370 --> 00:25:13,940
that well if you come along on one of

648
00:25:12,020 --> 00:25:17,090
the courses and you ask me nicely I

649
00:25:13,940 --> 00:25:17,990
might take my shirt off to show you and

650
00:25:17,090 --> 00:25:19,790
you ask me that question

651
00:25:17,990 --> 00:25:21,320
to show you the scar I have here on my

652
00:25:19,790 --> 00:25:23,090
shoulder there across the top of my

653
00:25:21,320 --> 00:25:26,990
pectoral and down here on my ribcage

654
00:25:23,090 --> 00:25:30,440
that was from about just over ten years

655
00:25:26,990 --> 00:25:32,390
ago now where I was attacked whilst

656
00:25:30,440 --> 00:25:35,600
intervening in someone kicking his

657
00:25:32,390 --> 00:25:37,520
girlfriend to death in a pub car park

658
00:25:35,600 --> 00:25:40,160
somewhere in rural Shropshire I was

659
00:25:37,520 --> 00:25:41,690
coming walking past not drinking not

660
00:25:40,160 --> 00:25:43,130
doing anything just happened to be

661
00:25:41,690 --> 00:25:45,500
walking past and I saw something

662
00:25:43,130 --> 00:25:47,690
happening I went over to intervene and

663
00:25:45,500 --> 00:25:49,280
the guy turned round with a knife in his

664
00:25:47,690 --> 00:25:51,670
hand and slashed me across my chest

665
00:25:49,280 --> 00:25:53,840
there stitches and all sorts of things

666
00:25:51,670 --> 00:25:57,080
and I was doing with something well

667
00:25:53,840 --> 00:25:58,700
almost identical to this it was a one of

668
00:25:57,080 --> 00:26:02,710
these retractable stanley knife type

669
00:25:58,700 --> 00:26:05,270
blades he'd stolen that from work it was

670
00:26:02,710 --> 00:26:08,240
something it was something he acquired

671
00:26:05,270 --> 00:26:09,290
anonymously and could ditch and he had

672
00:26:08,240 --> 00:26:11,500
it in his hand for the expressed

673
00:26:09,290 --> 00:26:14,920
purposes of injuring somebody

674
00:26:11,500 --> 00:26:17,080
and so I've been a victim of knife crime

675
00:26:14,920 --> 00:26:18,790
I have injuries I have a scar probably

676
00:26:17,080 --> 00:26:20,380
for life I mean I don't take my shirt

677
00:26:18,790 --> 00:26:23,020
off in public that often so I don't get

678
00:26:20,380 --> 00:26:25,090
much of a tan but when I do get a tan

679
00:26:23,020 --> 00:26:28,120
and I've had been working somewhere

680
00:26:25,090 --> 00:26:30,100
where my skin starts to get brown I've

681
00:26:28,120 --> 00:26:32,950
got a nice pale line here most of it's

682
00:26:30,100 --> 00:26:34,720
covered under chest hair and things but

683
00:26:32,950 --> 00:26:37,240
it is there if you come and see me in

684
00:26:34,720 --> 00:26:39,490
person I'll show it to you but I was

685
00:26:37,240 --> 00:26:41,560
done well with the equivalent to kitchen

686
00:26:39,490 --> 00:26:43,600
knife it was a cheap disposable blade

687
00:26:41,560 --> 00:26:47,080
that he had access to anonymously that

688
00:26:43,600 --> 00:26:48,790
was there part of his work and if you

689
00:26:47,080 --> 00:26:51,070
wanted a knife to cause a crime to

690
00:26:48,790 --> 00:26:56,080
commit a violent crime with he had

691
00:26:51,070 --> 00:26:58,690
access to one had nothing to do with an

692
00:26:56,080 --> 00:27:01,210
outdoor context and carrying that in

693
00:26:58,690 --> 00:27:02,620
your rucksack whilst getting on the

694
00:27:01,210 --> 00:27:05,830
train to go and do some Hill walking in

695
00:27:02,620 --> 00:27:09,040
the late district and that's part of the

696
00:27:05,830 --> 00:27:10,930
problem because decisions are made in

697
00:27:09,040 --> 00:27:12,940
cities by people who don't tend to do

698
00:27:10,930 --> 00:27:14,170
much Hill walking although our current

699
00:27:12,940 --> 00:27:18,190
prime minister apparently is a key in

700
00:27:14,170 --> 00:27:22,200
Hill Walker and guessing she doesn't

701
00:27:18,190 --> 00:27:25,150
carry something like that man changes in

702
00:27:22,200 --> 00:27:26,560
UK law and making knives the access

703
00:27:25,150 --> 00:27:27,400
denies more restrictive I don't think

704
00:27:26,560 --> 00:27:31,150
he's going to make a blind bit of

705
00:27:27,400 --> 00:27:32,080
difference because if that was well that

706
00:27:31,150 --> 00:27:35,200
happened again tomorrow

707
00:27:32,080 --> 00:27:38,440
the guy who slashed me could still

708
00:27:35,200 --> 00:27:41,140
access that from work and still steal a

709
00:27:38,440 --> 00:27:42,670
knife from the kitchen the problems with

710
00:27:41,140 --> 00:27:44,530
knife crime arm the knives the problems

711
00:27:42,670 --> 00:27:46,180
with knife crime are the reasons people

712
00:27:44,530 --> 00:27:48,820
are carrying them and that's what we

713
00:27:46,180 --> 00:27:50,110
need to address not the tools so thank

714
00:27:48,820 --> 00:27:52,720
you for watching if that was a slightly

715
00:27:50,110 --> 00:27:56,380
different video to normal to our other

716
00:27:52,720 --> 00:27:58,990
tutorials but that's what we do as a

717
00:27:56,380 --> 00:28:00,280
channel mostly tutorials I original

718
00:27:58,990 --> 00:28:02,230
outdoors it's a training and outdoor

719
00:28:00,280 --> 00:28:04,000
skills company or based up here in North

720
00:28:02,230 --> 00:28:05,110
Wales on the edge of Snowdonia if you

721
00:28:04,000 --> 00:28:07,420
have a look at the website there's all

722
00:28:05,110 --> 00:28:07,900
sorts of courses and there's blogs on

723
00:28:07,420 --> 00:28:10,000
there

724
00:28:07,900 --> 00:28:13,540
on the YouTube channel it's mostly

725
00:28:10,000 --> 00:28:14,650
tutorials gear reviews and some trip

726
00:28:13,540 --> 00:28:16,150
reports and things but there's more

727
00:28:14,650 --> 00:28:19,000
stuff going on there all the time

728
00:28:16,150 --> 00:28:21,100
that's what I do from work that's what

729
00:28:19,000 --> 00:28:22,929
