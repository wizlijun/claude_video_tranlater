00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,439
hey guys ryan gill here with hunt

2
00:00:01,439 --> 00:00:04,240
primitive where we entertain educate and

3
00:00:03,439 --> 00:00:07,040
inspire

4
00:00:04,240 --> 00:00:08,960
and we're working really hard to get you

5

where you want to be with your own

6
00:00:08,960 --> 00:00:13,120
primitive building and hunting journey

7
00:00:11,519 --> 00:00:15,040
on this channel we do a lot of primitive

8
00:00:13,120 --> 00:00:16,400
builds how to's and hunting videos this

9
00:00:15,040 --> 00:00:17,840
will be a how-to video if it is your

10
00:00:16,400 --> 00:00:19,439
first time in a channel do please

11
00:00:17,840 --> 00:00:19,920
consider subscribing and following along

12
00:00:19,439 --> 00:00:21,840
but

13
00:00:19,920 --> 00:00:23,519
hey what we're going to talk about today

14
00:00:21,840 --> 00:00:26,640
is how to identify

15
00:00:23,519 --> 00:00:28,960
good rocks for napping which napping is

16
00:00:26,640 --> 00:00:31,199
making arrowheads or making knife blades

17
00:00:28,960 --> 00:00:33,040
so i've got a lot of examples here to

18
00:00:31,199 --> 00:00:33,760
share with you guys today because i get

19
00:00:33,040 --> 00:00:37,040
a ton

20
00:00:33,760 --> 00:00:39,600
i mean a ridiculous ton of questions on

21
00:00:37,040 --> 00:00:41,600
how do i find napping rock and what does

22
00:00:39,600 --> 00:00:42,079
good napping rock even look like and you

23
00:00:41,600 --> 00:00:43,440
know what

24
00:00:42,079 --> 00:00:45,760
sometimes i take this for granted

25
00:00:43,440 --> 00:00:48,320
because i've been doing it for so long

26
00:00:45,760 --> 00:00:50,000
that i just assume that people just know

27
00:00:48,320 --> 00:00:51,600
what good napping rock looks like and

28
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:53,440
that's not the case at all so

29
00:00:51,600 --> 00:00:55,360
i've had to kind of reel it back in a

30
00:00:53,440 --> 00:00:57,199
little bit and say hey let me put this

31
00:00:55,360 --> 00:00:58,079
information out so you know what you're

32
00:00:57,199 --> 00:01:00,399
looking for

33
00:00:58,079 --> 00:01:01,920
when you go out looking for napping rock

34
00:01:00,399 --> 00:01:03,440
in your area

35
00:01:01,920 --> 00:01:06,080
probably one of the first things that i

36
00:01:03,440 --> 00:01:09,520
need to be really upfront about is

37
00:01:06,080 --> 00:01:11,680
good napping rock can be very

38
00:01:09,520 --> 00:01:13,920
tough to find it can be really easy to

39
00:01:11,680 --> 00:01:14,799
find if you live in the perfect place

40
00:01:13,920 --> 00:01:17,040
say like

41
00:01:14,799 --> 00:01:18,479
uh edward's plateau in texas people

42
00:01:17,040 --> 00:01:19,680
would say why would i ever pay for rock

43
00:01:18,479 --> 00:01:21,439
or why would i ever

44
00:01:19,680 --> 00:01:23,200
have to wonder like i just walk in my

45
00:01:21,439 --> 00:01:26,240
yard and pick it up well

46
00:01:23,200 --> 00:01:26,720
that is the anomaly most people don't

47
00:01:26,240 --> 00:01:29,600
have

48
00:01:26,720 --> 00:01:30,400
rock anywhere in their near vicinity

49
00:01:29,600 --> 00:01:33,439
that's actually

50
00:01:30,400 --> 00:01:34,640
good for napping so like native peoples

51
00:01:33,439 --> 00:01:37,439
used to travel

52
00:01:34,640 --> 00:01:38,560
great distances and also trade great

53
00:01:37,439 --> 00:01:40,640
distances for

54
00:01:38,560 --> 00:01:41,920
good sources of rock so there's even

55
00:01:40,640 --> 00:01:44,479
some places say

56
00:01:41,920 --> 00:01:46,880
like uh north and south carolina

57
00:01:44,479 --> 00:01:47,920
especially on the eastern side virginia

58
00:01:46,880 --> 00:01:50,240
georgia all that

59
00:01:47,920 --> 00:01:51,200
all like eastern seaboard like there's

60
00:01:50,240 --> 00:01:54,320
like no

61
00:01:51,200 --> 00:01:56,719
rock in that whole area so they were

62
00:01:54,320 --> 00:01:58,159
sourcing even poor rock and bringing it

63
00:01:56,719 --> 00:01:59,680
into the area like quartzite and

64
00:01:58,159 --> 00:02:02,320
rhyolite and stuff like that

65
00:01:59,680 --> 00:02:03,840
so there there's lots and lots of

66
00:02:02,320 --> 00:02:05,920
different places that don't have good

67
00:02:03,840 --> 00:02:08,239
rock and then you have other places

68
00:02:05,920 --> 00:02:10,160
that don't have rock everywhere but

69
00:02:08,239 --> 00:02:12,000
they've got little isolated

70
00:02:10,160 --> 00:02:13,120
pockets of it but here i'm going to go

71
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:13,599
through and i'm going to start showing

72
00:02:13,120 --> 00:02:15,760
you

73
00:02:13,599 --> 00:02:17,599
a few examples things to look for and

74
00:02:15,760 --> 00:02:20,720
also things to avoid

75
00:02:17,599 --> 00:02:22,080
so what makes good napping rock well it

76
00:02:20,720 --> 00:02:25,840
comes down to

77
00:02:22,080 --> 00:02:29,280
a very very basic uh thing to look for

78
00:02:25,840 --> 00:02:31,440
it's something that looks glassy or waxy

79
00:02:29,280 --> 00:02:34,239
okay so let's use this an example now

80
00:02:31,440 --> 00:02:35,040
this is again another anomaly okay so

81
00:02:34,239 --> 00:02:37,840
we're talking about

82
00:02:35,040 --> 00:02:39,599
obsidian okay this is volcanic glass you

83
00:02:37,840 --> 00:02:41,760
can look at this immediately and say

84
00:02:39,599 --> 00:02:43,440
this is good for napping this doesn't

85
00:02:41,760 --> 00:02:46,080
occur anywhere in the east

86
00:02:43,440 --> 00:02:46,959
this is stuff like oregon utah down into

87
00:02:46,080 --> 00:02:48,959
mexico

88
00:02:46,959 --> 00:02:50,879
it's volcanic glass you have to go for

89
00:02:48,959 --> 00:02:54,000
areas that are have either have

90
00:02:50,879 --> 00:02:55,519
active volcanoes or extinct volcanoes

91
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:58,000
but that's where you're going to find it

92
00:02:55,519 --> 00:02:59,599
not super common so no it doesn't exist

93
00:02:58,000 --> 00:03:00,159
in this area but if you've got that

94
00:02:59,599 --> 00:03:03,120
stuff

95
00:03:00,159 --> 00:03:03,599
it's phenomenal rock incredibly sharp

96
00:03:03,120 --> 00:03:05,840
now

97
00:03:03,599 --> 00:03:07,680
you have other places i mentioned the

98
00:03:05,840 --> 00:03:09,760
edwards plateau in texas

99
00:03:07,680 --> 00:03:12,319
before so this is a good example of that

100
00:03:09,760 --> 00:03:13,040
so this is a type of edwards chart which

101
00:03:12,319 --> 00:03:15,440
is

102
00:03:13,040 --> 00:03:17,280
uh a version of petronalis and you can

103
00:03:15,440 --> 00:03:19,599
see it's got a couple inclusions

104
00:03:17,280 --> 00:03:21,280
it's got a couple different colors and

105
00:03:19,599 --> 00:03:22,959
stuff in it and these aren't a big deal

106
00:03:21,280 --> 00:03:23,599
and i knocked this flake already off so

107
00:03:22,959 --> 00:03:28,239
when you

108
00:03:23,599 --> 00:03:31,519
find rock you see how it's glassy

109
00:03:28,239 --> 00:03:33,599
and will break really sharp and clean

110
00:03:31,519 --> 00:03:35,840
if you can knock a piece off and it's

111
00:03:33,599 --> 00:03:38,799
got a knife edge that can

112
00:03:35,840 --> 00:03:40,400
really cut some stuff that's good rock

113
00:03:38,799 --> 00:03:42,239
okay so this is chert

114
00:03:40,400 --> 00:03:44,000
the north american native edwards

115
00:03:42,239 --> 00:03:47,200
plateau chert specifically

116
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:50,080
a type of amoeba pattern alice and this

117
00:03:47,200 --> 00:03:51,680
is uh heat treated this is a very light

118
00:03:50,080 --> 00:03:52,799
heat treat on it some of it doesn't need

119
00:03:51,680 --> 00:03:56,239
heat treated at all

120
00:03:52,799 --> 00:03:57,040
now i do have a video on heat treating

121
00:03:56,239 --> 00:03:59,040
rock

122
00:03:57,040 --> 00:04:00,959
as well and i will link that down into

123
00:03:59,040 --> 00:04:01,360
the description not gonna lie it's an

124
00:04:00,959 --> 00:04:04,159
old

125
00:04:01,360 --> 00:04:05,840
really crappy video and i'm obnoxious to

126
00:04:04,159 --> 00:04:09,599
listen to because i'm trying to

127
00:04:05,840 --> 00:04:11,120
be some sort of over uh spoken voice on

128
00:04:09,599 --> 00:04:12,879
the whole thing and it sounds ridiculous

129
00:04:11,120 --> 00:04:15,040
but the information's good

130
00:04:12,879 --> 00:04:17,280
so stick with it like i said it's an old

131
00:04:15,040 --> 00:04:18,959
old video but the information is good on

132
00:04:17,280 --> 00:04:19,519
what heat treating is and what heat

133
00:04:18,959 --> 00:04:22,479
treating

134
00:04:19,519 --> 00:04:24,400
does heat treating can take kind of some

135
00:04:22,479 --> 00:04:25,199
crummy rocks and turn them into good

136
00:04:24,400 --> 00:04:28,639
rocks

137
00:04:25,199 --> 00:04:30,560
sometimes but not all the time

138
00:04:28,639 --> 00:04:32,720
okay so then next on the list we've got

139
00:04:30,560 --> 00:04:33,280
something kind of like a coastal plains

140
00:04:32,720 --> 00:04:34,320
chart

141
00:04:33,280 --> 00:04:36,240
where you're going to look at it like

142
00:04:34,320 --> 00:04:38,160
this and say okay well it breaks kind of

143
00:04:36,240 --> 00:04:39,840
clean but you can see it's not super

144
00:04:38,160 --> 00:04:41,759
clean it's got like tear marks it's got

145
00:04:39,840 --> 00:04:44,800
these little inclusions

146
00:04:41,759 --> 00:04:46,720
all over in fossils so this is actually

147
00:04:44,800 --> 00:04:48,320
a raw piece i could make it a little bit

148
00:04:46,720 --> 00:04:51,120
better with heat

149
00:04:48,320 --> 00:04:51,680
but overall this is a decent maybe a

150
00:04:51,120 --> 00:04:54,400
medium

151
00:04:51,680 --> 00:04:56,000
grade type of rock if you find this

152
00:04:54,400 --> 00:04:58,320
it'll certainly nap

153
00:04:56,000 --> 00:04:59,040
you can even see the patina difference

154
00:04:58,320 --> 00:05:01,280
um

155
00:04:59,040 --> 00:05:02,720
you know when this was probably exposed

156
00:05:01,280 --> 00:05:04,000
for quite a long time

157
00:05:02,720 --> 00:05:05,759
you know probably not a huge amount of

158
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:07,039
time from when it broke off and then

159
00:05:05,759 --> 00:05:09,120
this is what it looks like when it's a

160
00:05:07,039 --> 00:05:11,759
fresh break so they do patina

161
00:05:09,120 --> 00:05:12,639
just even in a couple years you'll get a

162
00:05:11,759 --> 00:05:15,280
a

163
00:05:12,639 --> 00:05:18,880
difference in color and even texture but

164
00:05:15,280 --> 00:05:20,960
it produces a relatively sharp edge

165
00:05:18,880 --> 00:05:22,000
so that's something to look for kind of

166
00:05:20,960 --> 00:05:23,840
a medium grade

167
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:25,440
but you can't always judge a book by its

168
00:05:23,840 --> 00:05:27,440
cover either because you can pick a

169
00:05:25,440 --> 00:05:29,600
say a rock up from the creek and it

170
00:05:27,440 --> 00:05:31,120
might look like this

171
00:05:29,600 --> 00:05:32,800
right and you say well that's obviously

172
00:05:31,120 --> 00:05:34,720
that's not good rock i can't

173
00:05:32,800 --> 00:05:36,560
i can't do anything with that rock it's

174
00:05:34,720 --> 00:05:37,039
all grainy it's all crappy but when you

175
00:05:36,560 --> 00:05:40,880
crack

176
00:05:37,039 --> 00:05:43,919
open boom probably one of the

177
00:05:40,880 --> 00:05:44,479
best rocks that you can ever nap in the

178
00:05:43,919 --> 00:05:46,160
world

179
00:05:44,479 --> 00:05:48,000
and you know english flint's very very

180
00:05:46,160 --> 00:05:50,800
similar to that polish flint's

181
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:52,639
french flint so this is a type of

182
00:05:50,800 --> 00:05:54,320
georgetown which is again a part of

183
00:05:52,639 --> 00:05:56,720
edward's plateau

184
00:05:54,320 --> 00:05:58,160
and it is phenomenal rock but you would

185
00:05:56,720 --> 00:05:59,680
never know it to look at it from the

186
00:05:58,160 --> 00:06:01,759
outside

187
00:05:59,680 --> 00:06:03,120
so another one to really consider if you

188
00:06:01,759 --> 00:06:05,520
look at this it is

189
00:06:03,120 --> 00:06:06,960
probably the worst looking rock ever

190
00:06:05,520 --> 00:06:07,919
that you could pick up and say i could

191
00:06:06,960 --> 00:06:09,120
never nap this

192
00:06:07,919 --> 00:06:10,800
this is why you have to go in the woods

193
00:06:09,120 --> 00:06:12,319
and you have to start breaking them now

194
00:06:10,800 --> 00:06:14,319
this is agatized coral

195
00:06:12,319 --> 00:06:16,000
your average creek rock that you find

196
00:06:14,319 --> 00:06:17,600
that's ugly like this when you break it

197
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:19,280
open is not going to be pretty

198
00:06:17,600 --> 00:06:20,720
but every now and then when you find the

199
00:06:19,280 --> 00:06:23,280
right place

200
00:06:20,720 --> 00:06:25,199
boom that's the stuff you're looking for

201
00:06:23,280 --> 00:06:28,319
see how it went from crummy crap

202
00:06:25,199 --> 00:06:29,280
to immediately glassy and waxy and this

203
00:06:28,319 --> 00:06:31,440
is raw

204
00:06:29,280 --> 00:06:33,280
so whenever if we do put a heat treat on

205
00:06:31,440 --> 00:06:34,880
this the color will pop and it'll get

206
00:06:33,280 --> 00:06:36,319
slicker and even better

207
00:06:34,880 --> 00:06:38,000
so that's one more thing to look for as

208
00:06:36,319 --> 00:06:40,000
well this is found

209
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:41,120
in south central florida specifically

210
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:42,720
pasco county

211
00:06:41,120 --> 00:06:45,440
getting harder and harder to come across

212
00:06:42,720 --> 00:06:47,759
because everything is private land

213
00:06:45,440 --> 00:06:49,520
so then there's a ton of other rocks

214
00:06:47,759 --> 00:06:51,039
like creek rocks and cobbles and stuff

215
00:06:49,520 --> 00:06:52,479
that you're like oh well i found stuff

216
00:06:51,039 --> 00:06:53,520
and it was rough on the outside when i

217
00:06:52,479 --> 00:06:55,840
break it open it'll

218
00:06:53,520 --> 00:06:56,560
be good right absolutely not if you

219
00:06:55,840 --> 00:06:58,319
break

220
00:06:56,560 --> 00:06:59,680
a rock open this is what most of your

221
00:06:58,319 --> 00:07:02,240
creek cobbles

222
00:06:59,680 --> 00:07:03,280
and anything that you're gonna find most

223
00:07:02,240 --> 00:07:04,720
places

224
00:07:03,280 --> 00:07:06,240
when you crack it open it's going to

225
00:07:04,720 --> 00:07:07,039
look like that and you'll say can that

226
00:07:06,240 --> 00:07:09,280
heat treat out

227
00:07:07,039 --> 00:07:11,199
nope absolutely not that is too that's

228
00:07:09,280 --> 00:07:12,080
that's we're not even in the same silica

229
00:07:11,199 --> 00:07:16,080
properties

230
00:07:12,080 --> 00:07:17,680
so i get a ton i mean a ton of people

231
00:07:16,080 --> 00:07:19,680
like i can't even stress that enough a

232
00:07:17,680 --> 00:07:20,639
ton of people that'll send me a rock

233
00:07:19,680 --> 00:07:22,319
like this and say

234
00:07:20,639 --> 00:07:24,000
can i make an arrowhead out of this you

235
00:07:22,319 --> 00:07:24,479
know because it's already somewhat flat

236
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:26,000
and thin

237
00:07:24,479 --> 00:07:27,919
it's in the shape can i turn this into

238
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:28,880
an arrowhead absolutely not because when

239
00:07:27,919 --> 00:07:31,120
you break it open

240
00:07:28,880 --> 00:07:33,120
it looks like this on the inside that is

241
00:07:31,120 --> 00:07:35,599
a non-nappable

242
00:07:33,120 --> 00:07:37,360
type of rock you can't use it no matter

243
00:07:35,599 --> 00:07:37,680
what kind of heat you put into it sort

244
00:07:37,360 --> 00:07:40,880
of

245
00:07:37,680 --> 00:07:43,280
melting it down into magma

246
00:07:40,880 --> 00:07:44,400
and maybe trying to figure out how to

247
00:07:43,280 --> 00:07:45,840
make obsidian

248
00:07:44,400 --> 00:07:48,319
you can't do it let's just put it that

249
00:07:45,840 --> 00:07:50,720
way okay so then you may even

250
00:07:48,319 --> 00:07:52,240
live in an area that's got phenomenal

251
00:07:50,720 --> 00:07:54,000
rock and you think well i just need to

252
00:07:52,240 --> 00:07:56,240
go out and pick out a piece of flint so

253
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:58,160
you can take a piece of edwards plateau

254
00:07:56,240 --> 00:07:58,800
flint that you think or shirt that you

255
00:07:58,160 --> 00:08:00,400
think

256
00:07:58,800 --> 00:08:02,080
should be really awesome but then

257
00:08:00,400 --> 00:08:04,960
there's different grades of it

258
00:08:02,080 --> 00:08:06,080
as well so then you pop it open and it

259
00:08:04,960 --> 00:08:08,160
looks like this

260
00:08:06,080 --> 00:08:09,919
it's got a real good up close look how

261
00:08:08,160 --> 00:08:12,879
trashy that is

262
00:08:09,919 --> 00:08:14,240
so many inclusions so many tear marks

263
00:08:12,879 --> 00:08:17,199
can it be used

264
00:08:14,240 --> 00:08:19,039
you know in a very worst case scenario

265
00:08:17,199 --> 00:08:21,280
you can probably knock some

266
00:08:19,039 --> 00:08:22,319
usable flakes off this heat treat them

267
00:08:21,280 --> 00:08:25,919
and get by

268
00:08:22,319 --> 00:08:26,720
but overall that is not good napping

269
00:08:25,919 --> 00:08:30,240
rock

270
00:08:26,720 --> 00:08:30,879
compared to that you can tell the

271
00:08:30,240 --> 00:08:33,839
difference

272
00:08:30,879 --> 00:08:35,039
this is what you're looking for now it

273
00:08:33,839 --> 00:08:38,320
doesn't have to be that color

274
00:08:35,039 --> 00:08:39,200
again this you can tell the difference

275
00:08:38,320 --> 00:08:43,039
when you look at this

276
00:08:39,200 --> 00:08:46,399
it's slick and waxy and beautiful

277
00:08:43,039 --> 00:08:49,360
and this is trashy and grainy

278
00:08:46,399 --> 00:08:51,519
and full of little fractures and all

279
00:08:49,360 --> 00:08:53,200
kinds of stuff that stuff's no good

280
00:08:51,519 --> 00:08:54,800
and it touched just a little bit more on

281
00:08:53,200 --> 00:08:59,120
that you could take some of the

282
00:08:54,800 --> 00:09:02,560
highest grade rock in the world

283
00:08:59,120 --> 00:09:04,959
okay and you can have stuff that is

284
00:09:02,560 --> 00:09:08,160
freeze fractured so even though it is

285
00:09:04,959 --> 00:09:12,160
glassy and it is beautiful rock right

286
00:09:08,160 --> 00:09:15,440
it is so freeze fractured pot littered

287
00:09:12,160 --> 00:09:16,320
and a mess that you will never be able

288
00:09:15,440 --> 00:09:19,040
to nap that

289
00:09:16,320 --> 00:09:20,160
even though that it is just chalk full

290
00:09:19,040 --> 00:09:23,279
of silica

291
00:09:20,160 --> 00:09:26,480
and it comes from a beautiful source

292
00:09:23,279 --> 00:09:30,240
the fact is it's so damaged

293
00:09:26,480 --> 00:09:32,640
from freeze cracking that it is unusable

294
00:09:30,240 --> 00:09:34,880
it'll crumble when you hit it and this

295
00:09:32,640 --> 00:09:35,600
is also what happens if you overheat

296
00:09:34,880 --> 00:09:37,440
rock

297
00:09:35,600 --> 00:09:39,600
if you put too much heat to it in the

298
00:09:37,440 --> 00:09:41,360
heating process it'll start developing

299
00:09:39,600 --> 00:09:42,000
these fractures and spider web all the

300
00:09:41,360 --> 00:09:43,600
way through it

301
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:45,440
and it'll completely ruin it so the heat

302
00:09:43,600 --> 00:09:47,360
treating process is actually fairly

303
00:09:45,440 --> 00:09:51,040
dangerous within itself

304
00:09:47,360 --> 00:09:52,240
there are then just a couple exceptions

305
00:09:51,040 --> 00:09:53,680
yet to the rule

306
00:09:52,240 --> 00:09:55,760
because you can take a rock like this

307
00:09:53,680 --> 00:09:58,560
this is agatized coral as well

308
00:09:55,760 --> 00:09:58,959
and you can see how rough and trashy it

309
00:09:58,560 --> 00:10:01,519
is

310
00:09:58,959 --> 00:10:03,600
but when we heat treat it and this is

311
00:10:01,519 --> 00:10:05,120
not the norm you normally can't find a

312
00:10:03,600 --> 00:10:06,480
rock that looks like this so like say

313
00:10:05,120 --> 00:10:08,079
where's that other one we picked up

314
00:10:06,480 --> 00:10:09,680
that looks like this and say can i heat

315
00:10:08,079 --> 00:10:10,959
treat that and it'll turn nice no this

316
00:10:09,680 --> 00:10:14,640
one will not do it

317
00:10:10,959 --> 00:10:17,200
there are a few that will look like this

318
00:10:14,640 --> 00:10:17,920
and then when you heat treat them after

319
00:10:17,200 --> 00:10:20,320
you heat treat

320
00:10:17,920 --> 00:10:21,839
them they still look like this until you

321
00:10:20,320 --> 00:10:24,880
break

322
00:10:21,839 --> 00:10:25,680
a piece off let's get the camera to

323
00:10:24,880 --> 00:10:29,360
focus

324
00:10:25,680 --> 00:10:30,959
and you can see how it went from grainy

325
00:10:29,360 --> 00:10:32,720
this one's easier you can actually see

326
00:10:30,959 --> 00:10:35,040
the little coral polyps in here

327
00:10:32,720 --> 00:10:36,720
nicole the fossil the polyp fossils

328
00:10:35,040 --> 00:10:37,279
super neats million and a half year old

329
00:10:36,720 --> 00:10:38,959
coral

330
00:10:37,279 --> 00:10:40,560
so this is what it looks like see how

331
00:10:38,959 --> 00:10:41,120
gnarly that is say i can't do anything

332
00:10:40,560 --> 00:10:43,600
with it

333
00:10:41,120 --> 00:10:44,320
and then you break it and it's slick and

334
00:10:43,600 --> 00:10:47,600
clean so

335
00:10:44,320 --> 00:10:48,560
heat treating can do wonders for a piece

336
00:10:47,600 --> 00:10:51,600
of rock

337
00:10:48,560 --> 00:10:53,680
if it's the right type of rock all right

338
00:10:51,600 --> 00:10:55,760
folks so hopefully this answers a ton of

339
00:10:53,680 --> 00:10:56,240
your questions on what to look for for

340
00:10:55,760 --> 00:10:57,839
different

341
00:10:56,240 --> 00:11:00,880
napping rocks one of the things you can

342
00:10:57,839 --> 00:11:03,040
do is if you say what am i looking for

343
00:11:00,880 --> 00:11:04,079
in my own area i don't even what kind of

344
00:11:03,040 --> 00:11:05,760
rock do we have

345
00:11:04,079 --> 00:11:07,120
instead of sending me a question or

346
00:11:05,760 --> 00:11:08,959
other people questions saying

347
00:11:07,120 --> 00:11:10,880
what kind of rock do we have in our area

348
00:11:08,959 --> 00:11:13,040
what you should do is start looking

349
00:11:10,880 --> 00:11:15,600
around and even go to local museums

350
00:11:13,040 --> 00:11:16,320
and look for artifacts that they have

351
00:11:15,600 --> 00:11:18,720
that are from

352
00:11:16,320 --> 00:11:19,519
the region locally and that will show

353
00:11:18,720 --> 00:11:21,839
you what the

354
00:11:19,519 --> 00:11:22,959
local rock looks like now there are a

355
00:11:21,839 --> 00:11:25,760
couple little

356
00:11:22,959 --> 00:11:26,959
changes or little nuances for different

357
00:11:25,760 --> 00:11:30,160
areas because

358
00:11:26,959 --> 00:11:32,079
what can happen is a rock say

359
00:11:30,160 --> 00:11:33,839
say central alabama's great great

360
00:11:32,079 --> 00:11:35,920
example the rock will be yellow

361
00:11:33,839 --> 00:11:37,040
in its natural form but if it's heat

362
00:11:35,920 --> 00:11:39,440
treated it'll turn

363
00:11:37,040 --> 00:11:40,160
red okay so then what will happen you go

364
00:11:39,440 --> 00:11:42,399
to

365
00:11:40,160 --> 00:11:44,160
a museum that say has a whole bunch of

366
00:11:42,399 --> 00:11:46,160
woodland points and they're all this

367
00:11:44,160 --> 00:11:47,440
like really red waxy look and say where

368
00:11:46,160 --> 00:11:48,560
can i find this i don't i can't find

369
00:11:47,440 --> 00:11:50,639
this stuff anywhere

370
00:11:48,560 --> 00:11:51,920
the rock is actually a little grainier

371
00:11:50,639 --> 00:11:53,920
and it's yellow

372
00:11:51,920 --> 00:11:55,360
but they learn to heat treat it which

373
00:11:53,920 --> 00:11:57,839
makes it slick

374
00:11:55,360 --> 00:11:58,560
and red so sometimes you just gotta get

375
00:11:57,839 --> 00:12:00,320
on the ground

376
00:11:58,560 --> 00:12:02,320
you know put boots on the ground do some

377
00:12:00,320 --> 00:12:04,160
homework really look around

378
00:12:02,320 --> 00:12:05,360
talk to some geologists they'll usually

379
00:12:04,160 --> 00:12:06,880
help you out and let you know if they

380
00:12:05,360 --> 00:12:09,600
found anything in the area that

381
00:12:06,880 --> 00:12:10,480
you know is a high silica type of uh you

382
00:12:09,600 --> 00:12:13,440
know chirp

383
00:12:10,480 --> 00:12:14,959
jasper agate that kind of thing again a

384
00:12:13,440 --> 00:12:16,800
lot of states don't have good napping

385
00:12:14,959 --> 00:12:17,760
rocks some have a phenomenal amount of

386
00:12:16,800 --> 00:12:20,079
napping rock

387
00:12:17,760 --> 00:12:22,160
some have really good honey holes of

388
00:12:20,079 --> 00:12:22,880
rock that nobody even knows that they

389
00:12:22,160 --> 00:12:25,680
are air

390
00:12:22,880 --> 00:12:26,880
there but you have to just get out and

391
00:12:25,680 --> 00:12:29,920
look for them

392
00:12:26,880 --> 00:12:33,600
but again don't pick stuff

393
00:12:29,920 --> 00:12:35,920
up that looks like this and completely

394
00:12:33,600 --> 00:12:37,519
disregard it because on the inside it

395
00:12:35,920 --> 00:12:40,880
could look like this

396
00:12:37,519 --> 00:12:42,800
but once you break it if it looks

397
00:12:40,880 --> 00:12:44,560
like this you know you're onto the right

398
00:12:42,800 --> 00:12:45,519
path because how awesome is but this is

399
00:12:44,560 --> 00:12:48,560
a crappy piece

400
00:12:45,519 --> 00:12:50,560
look for one that looks like this

401
00:12:48,560 --> 00:12:52,000
that's not freeze cracked and a little

402
00:12:50,560 --> 00:12:54,160
trick to that is

403
00:12:52,000 --> 00:12:56,000
dig down underneath the ground so the

404
00:12:54,160 --> 00:12:58,639
stuff you find at the surface has abso

405
00:12:56,000 --> 00:12:59,839
has taken in water over a period of time

406
00:12:58,639 --> 00:13:02,320
and then it freezes

407
00:12:59,839 --> 00:13:03,680
the ice expands and pops the rock and

408
00:13:02,320 --> 00:13:06,240
puts all those fractures

409
00:13:03,680 --> 00:13:08,240
so if you dig down below that level you

410
00:13:06,240 --> 00:13:10,880
might find stuff that has not actually

411
00:13:08,240 --> 00:13:11,760
frozen and popped so that's a little

412
00:13:10,880 --> 00:13:13,760
another little trip

413
00:13:11,760 --> 00:13:15,760
trick for you but all the stuff that

414
00:13:13,760 --> 00:13:18,320
looks like this

415
00:13:15,760 --> 00:13:19,600
and you break it open and it still looks

416
00:13:18,320 --> 00:13:21,839
like this

417
00:13:19,600 --> 00:13:23,440
don't use that stuff okay you can't use

418
00:13:21,839 --> 00:13:24,880
it it doesn't really matter how much

419
00:13:23,440 --> 00:13:26,560
heat you put to it

420
00:13:24,880 --> 00:13:28,560
if you've got something that you think

421
00:13:26,560 --> 00:13:30,320
could be good like the

422
00:13:28,560 --> 00:13:32,160
like the agatized coral and it's a

423
00:13:30,320 --> 00:13:32,959
little bit grainy try the heat treating

424
00:13:32,160 --> 00:13:35,440
process

425
00:13:32,959 --> 00:13:37,120
if it doesn't break smooth and clean

426
00:13:35,440 --> 00:13:38,000
then chances are it's just never going

427
00:13:37,120 --> 00:13:40,240
to work for you

428
00:13:38,000 --> 00:13:42,000
so thanks for following along i hoped

429
00:13:40,240 --> 00:13:43,279

00:13:42,000 --> 00:13:45,279
get to where you want to be in your own

431
00:13:43,279 --> 00:13:46,720
primitive adventures and thanks for

432
00:13:45,279 --> 00:13:49,839
following along and we'll catch you

433
00:13:46,720 --> 00:13:49,839
