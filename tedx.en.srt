[Music]

3
00:00:07,680 --> 00:00:11,440
At the turn of this century when I

4
00:00:09,280 --> 00:00:13,840
started to learn software engineering my

5
00:00:11,440 --> 00:00:17,600
one of my professors told us that in the

6
00:00:13,840 --> 00:00:19,760
future every job is a programming job.

7
00:00:17,600 --> 00:00:22,480
That's in 2001

8
00:00:19,760 --> 00:00:25,119
and he said that we're holding a golden

9
00:00:22,480 --> 00:00:28,880
ticket to job security.

10
00:00:25,119 --> 00:00:31,599
Just last month, the CEO of GitHub said

11
00:00:28,880 --> 00:00:34,160
that the future of programming is

12
00:00:31,599 --> 00:00:36,000
natural language.

13
00:00:34,160 --> 00:00:38,079
It looks like the prediction of my

14
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:40,719
professor at the turn of this century is

15
00:00:38,079 --> 00:00:43,360
going to become true, but probably not

16
00:00:40,719 --> 00:00:45,840
in the way that he had imagined.

17
00:00:43,360 --> 00:00:48,000
Artificial intelligence is capable of

18
00:00:45,840 --> 00:00:51,520
writing code for you through a natural

19
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:54,079
language prompt. GitHub C-Pilot can

20
00:00:51,520 --> 00:00:57,520
complete code for you and fix bugs for

21
00:00:54,079 --> 00:01:00,399
you. and chat GBT can create an entire

22
00:00:57,520 --> 00:01:03,760
project for you within seconds and all

23
00:01:00,399 --> 00:01:06,720
these tools available to anyone.

24
00:01:03,760 --> 00:01:09,680
So I find myself wondering, have we lost

25
00:01:06,720 --> 00:01:13,439
our golden tickets to job security?

26
00:01:09,680 --> 00:01:16,000
And as a CST professor and a father to a

27
00:01:13,439 --> 00:01:18,720
daughter who studies computer science,

28
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:21,200
there's a bigger question for me.

29
00:01:18,720 --> 00:01:23,600
If AI is going to do programming, does

30
00:01:21,200 --> 00:01:26,880
it still worth it for us to learn

31
00:01:23,600 --> 00:01:28,960
software engineering anymore?

32
00:01:26,880 --> 00:01:31,119
Today, I would like to explore this

33
00:01:28,960 --> 00:01:33,360
question with all you guys. Let's talk

34
00:01:31,119 --> 00:01:36,479
about what AI can do and more

35
00:01:33,360 --> 00:01:38,960
importantly, how we can how our students

36
00:01:36,479 --> 00:01:41,360
of software engineering uh prepare for

37
00:01:38,960 --> 00:01:44,479
the future roles of a real software

38
00:01:41,360 --> 00:01:47,759
engineer. So, let's dive in. First,

39
00:01:44,479 --> 00:01:50,720
let's talk about what AI is good at in

40
00:01:47,759 --> 00:01:52,640
when in terms of programming. AI is

41
00:01:50,720 --> 00:01:55,040
really good at generating thousands of

42
00:01:52,640 --> 00:01:57,680
lines of code. It translate between

43
00:01:55,040 --> 00:02:02,079
programming languages. It can create

44
00:01:57,680 --> 00:02:05,600
user uh interfaces and fix bugs for you

45
00:02:02,079 --> 00:02:08,000
and it excels at repetitive tasks and

46
00:02:05,600 --> 00:02:10,560
you know pattern recognition.

47
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:13,360
You know, once I asked ChatGBT to create

48
00:02:10,560 --> 00:02:16,959
a project for me, uh, a dating app like

49
00:02:13,360 --> 00:02:18,879
Tinder in Python, and within seconds, it

50
00:02:16,959 --> 00:02:21,360
actually created a a complete

51
00:02:18,879 --> 00:02:23,599
application with user profiles, the

52
00:02:21,360 --> 00:02:26,080
swiping logic, and even a sample

53
00:02:23,599 --> 00:02:30,680
database. The only thing didn't it

54
00:02:26,080 --> 00:02:30,680
didn't do for me is find me a date.

55
00:02:30,720 --> 00:02:34,720
But AI has a lot of limitations. We have

56
00:02:32,720 --> 00:02:36,480
to accept that. you know, it still

57
00:02:34,720 --> 00:02:39,200
doesn't understand the why behind all

58
00:02:36,480 --> 00:02:42,080
the tasks we asked them to do. Um, it's

59
00:02:39,200 --> 00:02:45,280
it's um it needs you human input for

60
00:02:42,080 --> 00:02:48,080
real world context and scenarios. It may

61
00:02:45,280 --> 00:02:51,440
not work well prioritizing long-term

62
00:02:48,080 --> 00:02:53,760
business goals and assessing trade-offs.

63
00:02:51,440 --> 00:02:55,280
And last but not least, it's not

64
00:02:53,760 --> 00:02:57,599
reliable.

65
00:02:55,280 --> 00:03:00,560
It hallucinates and sometimes give us

66
00:02:57,599 --> 00:03:04,239
the wrong answer.

67
00:03:00,560 --> 00:03:06,239
The statistics say that 55% of the

68
00:03:04,239 --> 00:03:09,920
developers today are actually starting

69
00:03:06,239 --> 00:03:11,920
to use co-pilot but only 30% of them are

70
00:03:09,920 --> 00:03:14,080
accepting the outcome without any

71
00:03:11,920 --> 00:03:17,040
changes. So if you are a developer and

72
00:03:14,080 --> 00:03:19,200
you are not in the first 55%

73
00:03:17,040 --> 00:03:20,800
that means you're not using AI you're in

74
00:03:19,200 --> 00:03:24,159
trouble.

75
00:03:20,800 --> 00:03:26,400
But if you are in the 30% that means you

76
00:03:24,159 --> 00:03:29,400
trust AI too much. You may be in bigger

77
00:03:26,400 --> 00:03:29,400
trouble.

78
00:03:29,599 --> 00:03:33,519
All right. So, all the leading AIs today

79
00:03:31,920 --> 00:03:36,560
are built on top of large language

80
00:03:33,519 --> 00:03:39,120
models and it's trained on the text of

81
00:03:36,560 --> 00:03:41,840
human knowledge. It's impressive. If you

82
00:03:39,120 --> 00:03:44,319
give a clear prompt, it'll give you very

83
00:03:41,840 --> 00:03:46,879
good results. But all the strategic

84
00:03:44,319 --> 00:03:50,080
thinking are still us. It's the the

85
00:03:46,879 --> 00:03:52,959
human. And you can think of AI as a

86
00:03:50,080 --> 00:03:55,280
brilliant junior developer that you hire

87
00:03:52,959 --> 00:03:58,879
to your team and they can do a lot of

88
00:03:55,280 --> 00:04:03,120
jobs very quickly and efficiently. But

89
00:03:58,879 --> 00:04:06,000
it's up to us human to define the vision

90
00:04:03,120 --> 00:04:09,840
to validate the results and ensure what

91
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:11,439
we're building is good for the society.

92
00:04:09,840 --> 00:04:14,080
So there's another thing that I want to

93
00:04:11,439 --> 00:04:17,040
talk about that um AI is is struggling

94
00:04:14,080 --> 00:04:20,160
on. It's struggling to communicate and

95
00:04:17,040 --> 00:04:22,000
collaborate with human beings. Well,

96
00:04:20,160 --> 00:04:24,240
maybe you will say this is more of a

97
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:26,080
human problem, right? We humans

98
00:04:24,240 --> 00:04:28,320
sometimes deal with the same problem

99
00:04:26,080 --> 00:04:31,120
too. But this is something, you know, we

100
00:04:28,320 --> 00:04:33,919
will have to work out. Let AI do what AI

101
00:04:31,120 --> 00:04:36,720
is good at and we humans can take care

102
00:04:33,919 --> 00:04:38,800
of of the boring jobs such as handling

103
00:04:36,720 --> 00:04:40,800
office politics.

104
00:04:38,800 --> 00:04:43,759
All right. So, talked about the the

105
00:04:40,800 --> 00:04:45,440
capabilities and limitations of AI. Now

106
00:04:43,759 --> 00:04:48,000
we can take a look at the software

107
00:04:45,440 --> 00:04:50,639
engineering roles.

108
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:53,360
So software engineering roles is not

109
00:04:50,639 --> 00:04:55,680
just about writing code. It actually

110
00:04:53,360 --> 00:04:57,759
talks about you know we need to

111
00:04:55,680 --> 00:05:01,600
understand what the user needs. We need

112
00:04:57,759 --> 00:05:03,840
to uh collaborate across roles and also

113
00:05:01,600 --> 00:05:06,400
making tough decisions with empathy and

114
00:05:03,840 --> 00:05:08,240
responsibility. This is what a soft

115
00:05:06,400 --> 00:05:11,360
engineer should be doing, right? We're

116
00:05:08,240 --> 00:05:13,039
not just tax executors. uh the the best

117
00:05:11,360 --> 00:05:15,280
engineers are not the ones who code the

118
00:05:13,039 --> 00:05:17,360
fastest but the ones who think the

119
00:05:15,280 --> 00:05:20,160
deepest.

120
00:05:17,360 --> 00:05:22,320
So a good engineer will take messy

121
00:05:20,160 --> 00:05:24,800
problems, ambiguous problems and guide

122
00:05:22,320 --> 00:05:27,199
machines towards a structured and

123
00:05:24,800 --> 00:05:30,160
meaningful outcomes.

124
00:05:27,199 --> 00:05:33,120
So there are system architects who

125
00:05:30,160 --> 00:05:35,919
design the best solutions and they

126
00:05:33,120 --> 00:05:39,440
should be the AI collaborators who use

127
00:05:35,919 --> 00:05:42,160
AI to implement those solutions and then

128
00:05:39,440 --> 00:05:44,000
they need to be ethical technologist to

129
00:05:42,160 --> 00:05:46,639
make sure the solutions that we're

130
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:50,240
building are b truly benefiting human

131
00:05:46,639 --> 00:05:53,039
being. So AI is actually democratizing a

132
00:05:50,240 --> 00:05:56,320
lot of complicated technical pro tasks

133
00:05:53,039 --> 00:05:58,800
like today a designer can mock up an

134
00:05:56,320 --> 00:06:01,520
application and then you know it it's

135
00:05:58,800 --> 00:06:03,280
just with a prompt and also marketers

136
00:06:01,520 --> 00:06:05,600
they can they don't need data engineers

137
00:06:03,280 --> 00:06:08,560
they can just run data analytics with

138
00:06:05,600 --> 00:06:10,720
some you know without writing any code.

139
00:06:08,560 --> 00:06:13,759
Does that mean soft engineers are losing

140
00:06:10,720 --> 00:06:17,039
our advantages? The answer is no.

141
00:06:13,759 --> 00:06:19,919
actually you know it it it still remains

142
00:06:17,039 --> 00:06:22,479
essential for software engineers and the

143
00:06:19,919 --> 00:06:26,319
reason is as follows.

144
00:06:22,479 --> 00:06:29,199
First we understand AI better. We not

145
00:06:26,319 --> 00:06:31,759
only know how to prompt and we also know

146
00:06:29,199 --> 00:06:34,240
what's under the hood, the models, the

147
00:06:31,759 --> 00:06:37,520
data pipelines, the limitations and

148
00:06:34,240 --> 00:06:40,160
risks and the understanding of these are

149
00:06:37,520 --> 00:06:42,800
very important because AI is integrated

150
00:06:40,160 --> 00:06:46,160
into every product we're using and we're

151
00:06:42,800 --> 00:06:48,319
building in the future. Second, we can

152
00:06:46,160 --> 00:06:51,280
make better use of AI when building

153
00:06:48,319 --> 00:06:53,680
software. So nowadays anybody can you

154
00:06:51,280 --> 00:06:56,720
know prototype a demo or or create a

155
00:06:53,680 --> 00:06:59,919
simple application of features but

156
00:06:56,720 --> 00:07:02,880
softwares think of the bigger picture.

157
00:06:59,919 --> 00:07:05,199
We are actually using AI to build a

158
00:07:02,880 --> 00:07:07,680
production ready software that is

159
00:07:05,199 --> 00:07:10,000
scalable reliable with long-term

160
00:07:07,680 --> 00:07:13,360
maintainability.

161
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:16,560
Finally we are making AI better. We

162
00:07:13,360 --> 00:07:19,520
fine-tune models. We optimize the

163
00:07:16,560 --> 00:07:22,160
performance and improve usability. We

164
00:07:19,520 --> 00:07:24,639
make AI available and useful for

165
00:07:22,160 --> 00:07:26,639
everybody else. The next generation of

166
00:07:24,639 --> 00:07:29,120
AI are still built by software

167
00:07:26,639 --> 00:07:32,639
engineers. Do you guys remember this

168
00:07:29,120 --> 00:07:35,599
quote from CEO of GitHub? This is not in

169
00:07:32,639 --> 00:07:38,800
reality yet. It's still up to the

170
00:07:35,599 --> 00:07:41,759
software engineers to improve AI and

171
00:07:38,800 --> 00:07:44,479
make this happen.

172
00:07:41,759 --> 00:07:46,960
So software engineers, we're not losing

173
00:07:44,479 --> 00:07:48,400
the golden ticket to job security. As a

174
00:07:46,960 --> 00:07:50,319
matter of fact, we're collecting even

175
00:07:48,400 --> 00:07:52,560
more because we're no longer just

176
00:07:50,319 --> 00:07:57,280
building software. We're actually

177
00:07:52,560 --> 00:08:00,879
building the future intelligence itself.

178
00:07:57,280 --> 00:08:04,000
And what we're how we train, direct, and

179
00:08:00,879 --> 00:08:07,199
supervise AI today will define the kind

180
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:10,319
of systems, technology, and society that

181
00:08:07,199 --> 00:08:13,199
we're building tomorrow.

182
00:08:10,319 --> 00:08:16,080
AI is raising the floor, but software

183
00:08:13,199 --> 00:08:18,400
engineers were raising the ceiling. And

184
00:08:16,080 --> 00:08:20,160
I want to share this not just with you.

185
00:08:18,400 --> 00:08:22,000
You can applaud. That's okay. I want to

186
00:08:20,160 --> 00:08:23,919
share this with not just system

187
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:26,080
engineers. This is for everyone. All

188
00:08:23,919 --> 00:08:28,319
right? We have AI that's rooting us up

189
00:08:26,080 --> 00:08:30,960
from the floor, but it's human that we

190
00:08:28,319 --> 00:08:33,200
have to reach to the ceiling and raise

191
00:08:30,960 --> 00:08:35,519
up the ceiling.

192
00:08:33,200 --> 00:08:36,719
All right? So after all these now we can

193
00:08:35,519 --> 00:08:38,719
talk about software engineering

194
00:08:36,719 --> 00:08:41,120
education, right? So you know in the

195
00:08:38,719 --> 00:08:43,680
past coding is very important piece of

196
00:08:41,120 --> 00:08:45,200
uh software engineering education but

197
00:08:43,680 --> 00:08:47,519
software engineering education is not

198
00:08:45,200 --> 00:08:49,519
just about writing code. It's also about

199
00:08:47,519 --> 00:08:52,000
you know teaching you how to break

200
00:08:49,519 --> 00:08:54,959
complex problems into steps think

201
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:57,440
logically and critically and harness the

202
00:08:54,959 --> 00:08:59,519
digital tools to build solutions that

203
00:08:57,440 --> 00:09:02,959
really matters.

204
00:08:59,519 --> 00:09:05,600
So in the time when everybody AI is

205
00:09:02,959 --> 00:09:08,640
everybody's assistant engineers becomes

206
00:09:05,600 --> 00:09:11,760
the orchestrators we remove remove

207
00:09:08,640 --> 00:09:14,240
barriers and open doors

208
00:09:11,760 --> 00:09:15,839
and in order for us to uh be a

209
00:09:14,240 --> 00:09:17,920
successful software engineer the

210
00:09:15,839 --> 00:09:20,800
students should go beyond learning code

211
00:09:17,920 --> 00:09:23,920
as quickly as possible and get into the

212
00:09:20,800 --> 00:09:25,680
following things

213
00:09:23,920 --> 00:09:27,440
you know so in order to become a

214
00:09:25,680 --> 00:09:29,360
successful engineer in the future we

215
00:09:27,440 --> 00:09:31,839
should focus on master to the

216
00:09:29,360 --> 00:09:33,760
foundations, the data structure, the

217
00:09:31,839 --> 00:09:35,279
algorithm, the programming concepts,

218
00:09:33,760 --> 00:09:37,760
they're still very important. Spend

219
00:09:35,279 --> 00:09:40,000
enough time to learn on these and make

220
00:09:37,760 --> 00:09:42,959
make become an expert on those because

221
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:47,519
they're the very important basics.

222
00:09:42,959 --> 00:09:50,560
Next, think about system like architect

223
00:09:47,519 --> 00:09:52,800
because you know uh aim higher, meet the

224
00:09:50,560 --> 00:09:55,040
expectation of a senior engineer as soon

225
00:09:52,800 --> 00:09:57,600
as possible and think about designing

226
00:09:55,040 --> 00:10:00,000
systems that can that is reliable and

227
00:09:57,600 --> 00:10:02,800
scalable.

228
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:05,760
go beyond u go full stack across

229
00:10:02,800 --> 00:10:08,720
disciplines. The days when a soft

230
00:10:05,760 --> 00:10:10,399
engineer can uh can focus on either the

231
00:10:08,720 --> 00:10:12,800
front end or the back end or the

232
00:10:10,399 --> 00:10:15,519
database is gone. The future software

233
00:10:12,800 --> 00:10:17,600
engineers all full stack engineers and

234
00:10:15,519 --> 00:10:19,440
there's more. You need to also get into

235
00:10:17,600 --> 00:10:22,160
the other disciplines like design,

236
00:10:19,440 --> 00:10:25,519
product, data, project management and be

237
00:10:22,160 --> 00:10:27,519
prepared to wear multiple hats.

238
00:10:25,519 --> 00:10:30,079
practice communication and

239
00:10:27,519 --> 00:10:33,600
collaborations. Learn to work with

240
00:10:30,079 --> 00:10:35,680
people um you know through team projects

241
00:10:33,600 --> 00:10:39,440
because you know in the future the way

242
00:10:35,680 --> 00:10:41,519
you if you can explain and connect it it

243
00:10:39,440 --> 00:10:44,720
it'll become increasingly important and

244
00:10:41,519 --> 00:10:47,839
it will set you apart.

245
00:10:44,720 --> 00:10:51,600
Use AI as a creative partner. Embrace

246
00:10:47,839 --> 00:10:53,600
UI, don't hate it, and learn LLM,

247
00:10:51,600 --> 00:10:57,279
generative AI, you know, model

248
00:10:53,600 --> 00:10:59,600
fine-tuning and uh rack, etc. You

249
00:10:57,279 --> 00:11:01,760
discuss your project with AI and

250
00:10:59,600 --> 00:11:03,920
delegate your work to AI as if it's one

251
00:11:01,760 --> 00:11:07,120
of your teammates.

252
00:11:03,920 --> 00:11:10,959
Last but not least, stay adaptable.

253
00:11:07,120 --> 00:11:13,519
Tools change, principles last. So, you

254
00:11:10,959 --> 00:11:15,360
should always focus on learning how to

255
00:11:13,519 --> 00:11:18,560
learn.

256
00:11:15,360 --> 00:11:20,800
So in the future when everyone uh can

257
00:11:18,560 --> 00:11:23,279
code a little the ones who can master

258
00:11:20,800 --> 00:11:26,399
the craft will build the path for

259
00:11:23,279 --> 00:11:29,440
everyone and becomes the leader. So in

260
00:11:26,399 --> 00:11:34,440
the era of AI software engineering is

261
00:11:29,440 --> 00:11:34,440
becoming the foundation of leadership.

262
00:11:34,640 --> 00:11:38,640
I've talked a lot about programming but

263
00:11:36,720 --> 00:11:40,399
perhaps programmer is no longer the

264
00:11:38,640 --> 00:11:42,959
right term we should be using to refer

265
00:11:40,399 --> 00:11:45,120
to software engineers. The software

266
00:11:42,959 --> 00:11:48,079
engineers of the AI era should be

267
00:11:45,120 --> 00:11:51,120
visionaries who can define meaningful

268
00:11:48,079 --> 00:11:55,200
result uh meaningful problems. A

269
00:11:51,120 --> 00:11:58,640
bridgeuer who can connect tools, teams

270
00:11:55,200 --> 00:12:02,240
and disciplines and leaders who not only

271
00:11:58,640 --> 00:12:04,000
lead human beings but also lead AI. So

272
00:12:02,240 --> 00:12:06,880
the future doesn't belong to those who

273
00:12:04,000 --> 00:12:08,560
code the fast fastest but it also it

274
00:12:06,880 --> 00:12:12,079
should belong to the one who think

275
00:12:08,560 --> 00:12:14,959
deeply adapt quickly and collaborate

276
00:12:12,079 --> 00:12:17,519
efficiently. They are the ones who don't

277
00:12:14,959 --> 00:12:19,360
just predict the future we build the

278
00:12:17,519 --> 00:12:21,080
future.

279
00:12:19,360 --> 00:12:21,640
Thank you.

280
00:12:21,080 --> 00:12:28,200
[Applause]
