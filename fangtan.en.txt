1
00:00:00,080 --> 00:00:03,600
You built and led Facebook news feeds.

2
00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:06,560
You shipped the messenger app as its own

3
00:00:03,600 --> 00:00:07,600
app. You launched Chad GPT enterprise.

4
00:00:06,560 --> 00:00:09,519
What's an important lesson you've

5
00:00:07,600 --> 00:00:11,599
learned about what it takes to succeed

6
00:00:09,519 --> 00:00:13,920
building something from idea to one to

7
00:00:11,599 --> 00:00:16,160
billions. You have to plan your chess

8
00:00:13,920 --> 00:00:19,119
moves out in advance. You have to really

9
00:00:16,160 --> 00:00:21,279
think before you act and build systems

10
00:00:19,119 --> 00:00:23,279
that are going to let you go sustainably

11
00:00:21,279 --> 00:00:25,119
faster. What's the most counterintuitive

12
00:00:23,279 --> 00:00:26,960
lesson you've learned? Sometimes your

13
00:00:25,119 --> 00:00:29,119
product actually doesn't matter. At

14
00:00:26,960 --> 00:00:31,519
Uber, I learned this because really the

15
00:00:29,119 --> 00:00:33,600
price and the ETA at Uber was the

16
00:00:31,519 --> 00:00:35,600
product. Looking at it from a holistic

17
00:00:33,600 --> 00:00:37,200
perspective, we humans consume the

18
00:00:35,600 --> 00:00:38,640
entirety of the product. It's not to say

19
00:00:37,200 --> 00:00:40,079
that you shouldn't fix the bug, but it

20
00:00:38,640 --> 00:00:42,000
doesn't have as much of an impact as

21
00:00:40,079 --> 00:00:43,600
something that is more important to

22
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:45,760
people. What's one specific thing you

23
00:00:43,600 --> 00:00:47,360
think will change in a big way with AI

24
00:00:45,760 --> 00:00:49,760
that people don't think enough about?

25
00:00:47,360 --> 00:00:51,760
Education is going to change. My son, he

26
00:00:49,760 --> 00:00:53,520
was nine at the time, built a custom GPT

27
00:00:51,760 --> 00:00:55,360
that you can type in any topic and it

28
00:00:53,520 --> 00:00:57,360
would give you a sentence that had every

29
00:00:55,360 --> 00:00:59,359
letter of the English alphabet. Isn't

30
00:00:57,360 --> 00:01:01,280
that mind-blowing? I can already see his

31
00:00:59,359 --> 00:01:03,840
brain rewiring. What's one thing you

32
00:01:01,280 --> 00:01:06,400
look for in people you hire? In 6

33
00:01:03,840 --> 00:01:08,400
months, if I'm telling you what to do,

34
00:01:06,400 --> 00:01:10,080
I've hired the wrong person. It helps me

35
00:01:08,400 --> 00:01:12,479
and the person operate on a different

36
00:01:10,080 --> 00:01:14,799
level where the goal is not, did you hit

37
00:01:12,479 --> 00:01:16,159
this OKR? The meta goal becomes, are we

38
00:01:14,799 --> 00:01:18,560
calibrating enough? Are we actually

39
00:01:16,159 --> 00:01:19,920
getting to a spot where in 6 months

40
00:01:18,560 --> 00:01:20,960
you're the one telling me what needs to

41
00:01:19,920 --> 00:01:22,159
be done? What's something you've learned

42
00:01:20,960 --> 00:01:23,840
about what it takes to be a great

43
00:01:22,159 --> 00:01:25,680
product person? I think there are five

44
00:01:23,840 --> 00:01:27,920
different types of product managers.

45
00:01:25,680 --> 00:01:30,640
Number one is

46
00:01:27,920 --> 00:01:33,119
today my guest is Peter Deng. Peter is

47
00:01:30,640 --> 00:01:34,640
maybe the most under the radar impactful

48
00:01:33,119 --> 00:01:36,720
product leader that you have never heard

49
00:01:34,640 --> 00:01:38,479
of. I often say that the best product

50
00:01:36,720 --> 00:01:40,560
people are not the people on Twitter and

51
00:01:38,479 --> 00:01:42,240
LinkedIn sharing advice, but the people

52
00:01:40,560 --> 00:01:44,720
who don't have time to do that because

53
00:01:42,240 --> 00:01:47,439
they are too busy doing the work. Peter

54
00:01:44,720 --> 00:01:49,439
is the epitome of this. He was VP of

55
00:01:47,439 --> 00:01:51,200
product at OpenAI where he oversaw

56
00:01:49,439 --> 00:01:53,920
product design and engineering for chat

57
00:01:51,200 --> 00:01:56,799
GBT and helped ship chat GPT enterprise

58
00:01:53,920 --> 00:01:59,040
voice memory desktop custom GBTs and

59
00:01:56,799 --> 00:02:00,799
more. He also oversaw and built their

60
00:01:59,040 --> 00:02:02,320
first growth team. He was the first head

61
00:02:00,799 --> 00:02:04,399
of product at Instagram where he worked

62
00:02:02,320 --> 00:02:06,079
closely with Mike and Kevin and oversaw

63
00:02:04,399 --> 00:02:08,080
all product development including on

64
00:02:06,079 --> 00:02:09,759
content sharing, ads growth, even helped

65
00:02:08,080 --> 00:02:11,760
build out their design and user research

66
00:02:09,759 --> 00:02:13,680
functions. He was also head of the rider

67
00:02:11,760 --> 00:02:15,200
product team at Uber where he oversaw

68
00:02:13,680 --> 00:02:16,800
everything in the rider app including

69
00:02:15,200 --> 00:02:18,800
big improvements to pickups and drop

70
00:02:16,800 --> 00:02:20,160
offs in Uber pool and airports. He also

71
00:02:18,800 --> 00:02:21,599
helped the team launch new products

72
00:02:20,160 --> 00:02:23,520
including Uber Reserve which is now

73
00:02:21,599 --> 00:02:25,599
approaching a $5 billion a year

74
00:02:23,520 --> 00:02:27,680
business. He also spent nearly 10 years

75
00:02:25,599 --> 00:02:29,760
at Facebook as their fourth ever product

76
00:02:27,680 --> 00:02:31,680
manager where he built and led the team

77
00:02:29,760 --> 00:02:33,519
behind the current newsfeed product, the

78
00:02:31,680 --> 00:02:35,599
standalone messenger app, also photos

79
00:02:33,519 --> 00:02:37,120
and groups and homepage and profiles. He

80
00:02:35,599 --> 00:02:38,319
was also chief product officer at Air

81
00:02:37,120 --> 00:02:39,920
Table where he helped the company

82
00:02:38,319 --> 00:02:41,599
systemize how they built products and

83
00:02:39,920 --> 00:02:43,840
transitioned to enterprise. He also led

84
00:02:41,599 --> 00:02:45,760
product management at Oculus. These days

85
00:02:43,840 --> 00:02:47,040
he is a general partner at Felicus where

86
00:02:45,760 --> 00:02:49,280
he's able to bring everything he's

87
00:02:47,040 --> 00:02:51,360
learned to more founders as an investor.

88
00:02:49,280 --> 00:02:53,120
He has never done a podcast before or

89
00:02:51,360 --> 00:02:55,280
shared any of these lessons or stories

90
00:02:53,120 --> 00:02:57,519
publicly. So you are in for a real

91
00:02:55,280 --> 00:02:59,599

106
00:03:21,200 --> 00:03:24,959
of you are building AI products, which

107
00:03:23,120 --> 00:03:28,080
is why I'm very excited to chat with

108
00:03:24,959 --> 00:03:30,080
Brandon Fu, founder and CEO of Paragon.

109
00:03:28,080 --> 00:03:32,879
Hey, Brandon. Hey, Lenny. Thanks for

110
00:03:30,080 --> 00:03:35,680
having me. So integrations have become a

111
00:03:32,879 --> 00:03:37,760
big deal for AI products. Why is that?

112
00:03:35,680 --> 00:03:40,239
Integrations are missionritical for AI

113
00:03:37,760 --> 00:03:41,840
for two reasons. First, AI products need

114
00:03:40,239 --> 00:03:44,239
contacts from their customers business

115
00:03:41,840 --> 00:03:47,519
data such as Google Drive files, Slack

116
00:03:44,239 --> 00:03:49,440
messages, or CRM records. Second, for AI

117
00:03:47,519 --> 00:03:51,920
products to automate work on behalf of

118
00:03:49,440 --> 00:03:53,440
users, AI agents need to be able to take

119
00:03:51,920 --> 00:03:55,519
action across these different third

120
00:03:53,440 --> 00:03:57,439
party tools. So where does Paragon fit

121
00:03:55,519 --> 00:03:59,040
into all this? Well, these integrations

122
00:03:57,439 --> 00:04:00,959
are a pain to build and that's why

123
00:03:59,040 --> 00:04:02,879
Paragon provides an embedded platform

124
00:04:00,959 --> 00:04:04,879
that enables engineers to ship these

125
00:04:02,879 --> 00:04:07,360
product integrations in just days

126
00:04:04,879 --> 00:04:09,680
instead of months across every use case

127
00:04:07,360 --> 00:04:11,840
from rag data ingestion to agentic

128
00:04:09,680 --> 00:04:13,280
actions. And I know from firsthand

129
00:04:11,840 --> 00:04:14,640
experience that maintenance is even

130
00:04:13,280 --> 00:04:17,199
harder than just building it for the

131
00:04:14,640 --> 00:04:18,959
first time. Exactly. We believe product

132
00:04:17,199 --> 00:04:20,639
teams should focus engineering efforts

133
00:04:18,959 --> 00:04:23,120
on competitive advantages, not

134
00:04:20,639 --> 00:04:25,840
integrations. That's why companies like

135
00:04:23,120 --> 00:04:27,600
you.com, AI21, and hundreds of others

136
00:04:25,840 --> 00:04:29,440
use Paragon to accelerate their

137
00:04:27,600 --> 00:04:31,120
integration strategy. If you want to

138
00:04:29,440 --> 00:04:32,800
avoid wasting months of engineering on

139
00:04:31,120 --> 00:04:34,080
integrations that your customers need,

169
00:05:41,440 --> 00:05:46,160
Peter, thank you so much for being here

170
00:05:43,759 --> 00:05:47,680
and welcome to the podcast. Thank you.

171
00:05:46,160 --> 00:05:49,120
I'm so thrilled to be here. Really

172
00:05:47,680 --> 00:05:51,360
honored. Looking forward to having a

173
00:05:49,120 --> 00:05:52,720
great time here. As we were preparing

174
00:05:51,360 --> 00:05:54,160
for this conversation, we were jamming

175
00:05:52,720 --> 00:05:56,080
on what we should focus on. There's so

176
00:05:54,160 --> 00:05:57,280
much that we're going to talk about, but

177
00:05:56,080 --> 00:05:58,479
something that you said was really

178
00:05:57,280 --> 00:06:00,960
interesting, and I'm really excited to

179
00:05:58,479 --> 00:06:02,639
start with this, which is that you've uh

180
00:06:00,960 --> 00:06:04,319
you've always felt that you haven't been

181
00:06:02,639 --> 00:06:05,680
able to say all the things you really

182
00:06:04,319 --> 00:06:08,000
think and feel because you've been

183
00:06:05,680 --> 00:06:09,680
within corporations, PR people, keeping

184
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:12,560
on message, and this is the first time

185
00:06:09,680 --> 00:06:14,400
that you feel free to share. First time.

186
00:06:12,560 --> 00:06:15,680
Okay. So, first of all, just how does

187
00:06:14,400 --> 00:06:16,960
that feel? Second of all, tell us

188
00:06:15,680 --> 00:06:19,039
something that you've been wanting to

189
00:06:16,960 --> 00:06:21,120
share that you can finally talk about.

190
00:06:19,039 --> 00:06:22,560
Well, it it feels really good. So I let

191
00:06:21,120 --> 00:06:25,919
me ask I love it that you're starting

192
00:06:22,560 --> 00:06:27,360
with a spicy question here. Um and um

193
00:06:25,919 --> 00:06:30,080
let me share some more context behind

194
00:06:27,360 --> 00:06:31,680
it. Um it's you know I'm here to speak

195
00:06:30,080 --> 00:06:32,880
more freely but it's not really what you

196
00:06:31,680 --> 00:06:34,960
think. I'm not here to divulge any

197
00:06:32,880 --> 00:06:36,880
secrets uh from the companies but

198
00:06:34,960 --> 00:06:39,680
naturally I'm kind of a storyteller. I'm

199
00:06:36,880 --> 00:06:41,919
kind of an introvert. So this podcast I

200
00:06:39,680 --> 00:06:45,600
feel like I have the ability to go

201
00:06:41,919 --> 00:06:47,520
deeper with you on uh any topic and kind

202
00:06:45,600 --> 00:06:49,440
of add the context because I think the

203
00:06:47,520 --> 00:06:52,240
new without some of the context some of

204
00:06:49,440 --> 00:06:54,720
my spicy takes or whatnot might be taken

205
00:06:52,240 --> 00:06:56,639
out of context and just not having the

206
00:06:54,720 --> 00:06:58,800
time pressure not feeling like there's

207
00:06:56,639 --> 00:07:00,400
some you know PR message I have to hit

208
00:06:58,800 --> 00:07:02,720
is just really freeing. So, it feels

209
00:07:00,400 --> 00:07:03,919
awesome. Really, anything that is on

210
00:07:02,720 --> 00:07:05,759
your mind that you would find

211
00:07:03,919 --> 00:07:07,680
interesting to your to your listeners,

212
00:07:05,759 --> 00:07:09,280
I'm here for it. And yeah, excited.

213
00:07:07,680 --> 00:07:10,400
Something I always tell guests, and I

214
00:07:09,280 --> 00:07:11,919
don't want people to take this out of

215
00:07:10,400 --> 00:07:14,960
context also, but I always describe

216
00:07:11,919 --> 00:07:16,880
myself as a a reverse journalist where I

217
00:07:14,960 --> 00:07:18,319
want the guest to be the best version of

218
00:07:16,880 --> 00:07:19,680
themselves. I never want to catch people

219
00:07:18,319 --> 00:07:22,400
off guard or just say something they

220
00:07:19,680 --> 00:07:24,479
never meant to say. So, that's a safe

221
00:07:22,400 --> 00:07:26,720
space. Okay. Okay. But still, is there

222
00:07:24,479 --> 00:07:27,680
anything that you want to share or that

223
00:07:26,720 --> 00:07:29,280
might be interesting to share that

224
00:07:27,680 --> 00:07:30,319
you've been wanting to share that you

225
00:07:29,280 --> 00:07:31,759
haven't been able to? Is there anything

226
00:07:30,319 --> 00:07:34,720
along those lines? I mean, always get

227
00:07:31,759 --> 00:07:36,960
this question around sort of, you know,

228
00:07:34,720 --> 00:07:40,319
AGI, is it coming? Is it going to is it

229
00:07:36,960 --> 00:07:42,400
going to solve everything?

230
00:07:40,319 --> 00:07:43,759
I mean, it's so interesting because, you

231
00:07:42,400 --> 00:07:45,840
know, when I was at OpenAI, it was

232
00:07:43,759 --> 00:07:48,800
around the time that people were really

233
00:07:45,840 --> 00:07:50,160
scared of AI and, you know, oh, it's

234
00:07:48,800 --> 00:07:51,520
going to, you know, get rid of humans or

235
00:07:50,160 --> 00:07:53,520
it's going to just, you know, do all

236
00:07:51,520 --> 00:07:55,120
these things. But with every technology,

237
00:07:53,520 --> 00:07:57,440
I think everyone's been just kind of

238
00:07:55,120 --> 00:07:58,800
taking some time to acclimate to it. And

239
00:07:57,440 --> 00:08:01,280
I think with AGI, it's a similar thing,

240
00:07:58,800 --> 00:08:02,879
which is it's so far out that everyone's

241
00:08:01,280 --> 00:08:04,560
like, well, is it is it what's what's

242
00:08:02,879 --> 00:08:06,960
our world going to be like? And the real

243
00:08:04,560 --> 00:08:09,039
answer is like none of us really know.

244
00:08:06,960 --> 00:08:11,520
But in terms of solving problems, I

245
00:08:09,039 --> 00:08:13,440
think some people believe AGI is going

246
00:08:11,520 --> 00:08:17,280
to solve everything, but I don't think

247
00:08:13,440 --> 00:08:19,360
so. Um, AGI is just necessary, but not

248
00:08:17,280 --> 00:08:21,199
sufficient. A lot of the value is still

249
00:08:19,360 --> 00:08:24,240
going to require a bunch of hustle from

250
00:08:21,199 --> 00:08:26,639
a lot of builders to really turn that

251
00:08:24,240 --> 00:08:30,319
new source of energy and channel it into

252
00:08:26,639 --> 00:08:32,959
something that we humans want to use

253
00:08:30,319 --> 00:08:34,959
that solves some of our problems. And

254
00:08:32,959 --> 00:08:36,399
that hustle is going to be required that

255
00:08:34,959 --> 00:08:38,159
elbow grease is going to be required to

256
00:08:36,399 --> 00:08:40,000
really make AGI something useful. Your

257
00:08:38,159 --> 00:08:41,599
point is that people think AGI hits all

258
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:43,120
of a sudden all jobs are gone. AGI is

259
00:08:41,599 --> 00:08:45,839
doing everything because I think this is

260
00:08:43,120 --> 00:08:49,440
a a optimistic message that things will

261
00:08:45,839 --> 00:08:50,720
be okay if AGI basically uh AGI being uh

262
00:08:49,440 --> 00:08:53,680
and I'm curious if you have a clearer

263
00:08:50,720 --> 00:08:55,839
definition but AGI being uh AI being

264
00:08:53,680 --> 00:08:58,320
just basically as smart as humans. Look,

265
00:08:55,839 --> 00:09:00,959
I'm I won't claim to be an expert on

266
00:08:58,320 --> 00:09:02,480
this at all. Um but I I just I think

267
00:09:00,959 --> 00:09:05,040
that with every technology that's come

268
00:09:02,480 --> 00:09:06,480
out, we've been able to harness it and

269
00:09:05,040 --> 00:09:07,519
it takes a lot of harnessing. I think

270
00:09:06,480 --> 00:09:09,600
I'm going to use that word very

271
00:09:07,519 --> 00:09:11,839
deliberately, right? I'll I'll use

272
00:09:09,600 --> 00:09:13,760
something really basic what seems

273
00:09:11,839 --> 00:09:15,760
obvious today is that you know there was

274
00:09:13,760 --> 00:09:17,200
a time when databases were all the rage.

275
00:09:15,760 --> 00:09:19,120
It's like, oh my goodness, you can store

276
00:09:17,200 --> 00:09:21,120
a bunch of data and you can query it

277
00:09:19,120 --> 00:09:24,080
really quickly and like imagine all the

278
00:09:21,120 --> 00:09:26,800
possibilities. And I think that a lot of

279
00:09:24,080 --> 00:09:28,720
amazing entrepreneurs and builders, you

280
00:09:26,800 --> 00:09:31,360
know, build some really great products

281
00:09:28,720 --> 00:09:33,200
on top of databases, right? In fact,

282
00:09:31,360 --> 00:09:35,120
that's kind of the basis of all the

283
00:09:33,200 --> 00:09:36,880
stuff that we're seeing today. And it

284
00:09:35,120 --> 00:09:38,720
seems so obvious today, but I I don't

285
00:09:36,880 --> 00:09:40,560
know, maybe in in, you know, 10 years,

286
00:09:38,720 --> 00:09:42,320
15 years when we look back, it's like,

287
00:09:40,560 --> 00:09:44,000
of course, it made sense that we have

288
00:09:42,320 --> 00:09:46,880
this super intelligent, you know,

289
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:48,640
thinking machine, but it requires uh

290
00:09:46,880 --> 00:09:50,640
product builders to be able to go in

291
00:09:48,640 --> 00:09:52,880
there and say, how do we channel this

292
00:09:50,640 --> 00:09:55,200
energy to make it something that we as

293
00:09:52,880 --> 00:09:56,880
humans love to use and want to use? I

294
00:09:55,200 --> 00:09:59,920
love the optimism around this. It's just

295
00:09:56,880 --> 00:10:01,839
like things will not go crazy once uh

296
00:09:59,920 --> 00:10:04,480
computers are as generally intelligent

297
00:10:01,839 --> 00:10:06,160
as as humans. I I I think that's that's

298
00:10:04,480 --> 00:10:07,680
exactly the the the what I'm trying to

299
00:10:06,160 --> 00:10:10,640
say and I think that again every

300
00:10:07,680 --> 00:10:12,720
technology people uh have this fear

301
00:10:10,640 --> 00:10:14,800
right and I remember reading or sorry

302
00:10:12,720 --> 00:10:16,320
watching a documentary once and they

303
00:10:14,800 --> 00:10:18,720
were talking about how when the bicycle

304
00:10:16,320 --> 00:10:20,480
came out people were like oh my goodness

305
00:10:18,720 --> 00:10:23,120
this is going to be the end of all

306
00:10:20,480 --> 00:10:25,600
things and it again it sounds silly

307
00:10:23,120 --> 00:10:27,360
today right because you're like bicycles

308
00:10:25,600 --> 00:10:30,240
really but then if you put yourself in

309
00:10:27,360 --> 00:10:32,399
the context in the mindset of a previous

310
00:10:30,240 --> 00:10:34,000
generation which you know are the next

311
00:10:32,399 --> 00:10:35,760
gener generation will be looking back at

312
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:37,760
this podcast in that previous

313
00:10:35,760 --> 00:10:39,839
generation. I think that, you know,

314
00:10:37,760 --> 00:10:41,519
again, I think optimistically things are

315
00:10:39,839 --> 00:10:42,959
going to be okay. We're going to adapt.

316
00:10:41,519 --> 00:10:44,800
Um, and this was actually one of the

317
00:10:42,959 --> 00:10:46,880
things that I talked about with my fresh

318
00:10:44,800 --> 00:10:49,760
friend Josh Constein at South by

319
00:10:46,880 --> 00:10:52,079
Southwest is this idea that humans will

320
00:10:49,760 --> 00:10:54,640
always co-evolve with technology. And I

321
00:10:52,079 --> 00:10:56,880
think that that co-evolution is already

322
00:10:54,640 --> 00:10:59,200
happening. If you take a look at sort of

323
00:10:56,880 --> 00:11:01,519
um there was a lot of uh a fear of AI

324
00:10:59,200 --> 00:11:03,279
just when Chachi BT came out but you

325
00:11:01,519 --> 00:11:05,360
know when you start to get familiar with

326
00:11:03,279 --> 00:11:07,680
it things that kind of things change and

327
00:11:05,360 --> 00:11:10,480
then you are able to to evolve from

328
00:11:07,680 --> 00:11:12,880
being you know fearful to uh familiar

329
00:11:10,480 --> 00:11:15,040
and to go all the way to having this

330
00:11:12,880 --> 00:11:16,640
this mastery of this thing of like oh my

331
00:11:15,040 --> 00:11:18,000
goodness like look at all the startups

332
00:11:16,640 --> 00:11:21,120
that are happening now all the things

333
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:23,360
that we can build right and just over 18

334
00:11:21,120 --> 00:11:25,200
months I would say we look back and

335
00:11:23,360 --> 00:11:28,240
there's been an attitude shift Right.

336
00:11:25,200 --> 00:11:30,560
And so I guess part of my optimism comes

337
00:11:28,240 --> 00:11:32,240
from if you look back 18 months and you

338
00:11:30,560 --> 00:11:33,920
look forward 18 months, like might it be

339
00:11:32,240 --> 00:11:36,320
the same thing for something that we're

340
00:11:33,920 --> 00:11:37,839
we're chasing now? Let me follow this AI

341
00:11:36,320 --> 00:11:38,959
thread a little bit more and then we can

342
00:11:37,839 --> 00:11:40,640
move on to other things. I feel like

343
00:11:38,959 --> 00:11:42,640
every conversation there's like a time

344
00:11:40,640 --> 00:11:44,000
to AI conversation and then it's like

345
00:11:42,640 --> 00:11:45,279
okay there's other things that also

346
00:11:44,000 --> 00:11:47,279
matter. So let me ask you this the

347
00:11:45,279 --> 00:11:49,519
question. What's what's one specific

348
00:11:47,279 --> 00:11:51,519
thing you think will change in a big way

349
00:11:49,519 --> 00:11:54,320
with AI that people don't think enough

350
00:11:51,519 --> 00:11:56,640
about? I think education is going to

351
00:11:54,320 --> 00:11:58,880
change in a big way. And I think a lot

352
00:11:56,640 --> 00:12:00,720
about this because um I'm involved in my

353
00:11:58,880 --> 00:12:02,640
kids school uh quite a bit and that's

354
00:12:00,720 --> 00:12:06,240
something I've done after I I left

355
00:12:02,640 --> 00:12:08,240
OpenAI. And what's fascinating to me is

356
00:12:06,240 --> 00:12:10,480
that, you know, watching my son who got

357
00:12:08,240 --> 00:12:12,399
to, you know, dog food a bunch of the

358
00:12:10,480 --> 00:12:14,160
Open AI stuff before it was public. I

359
00:12:12,399 --> 00:12:17,519
think that was uh I think I can saf

360
00:12:14,160 --> 00:12:20,880
safely say that that seems okay. And uh

361
00:12:17,519 --> 00:12:22,639
when he was was playing with like you

362
00:12:20,880 --> 00:12:25,120
know Chachi PT and some of the the

363
00:12:22,639 --> 00:12:27,760
latest models and he's he's uh he was

364
00:12:25,120 --> 00:12:31,279
nine at the time. I can already see his

365
00:12:27,760 --> 00:12:32,959
brain rewiring right he was starting to

366
00:12:31,279 --> 00:12:34,720
ask questions and he never heard the

367
00:12:32,959 --> 00:12:37,040
word prompt before but his like just

368
00:12:34,720 --> 00:12:39,040
this is how awesome the human mind is

369
00:12:37,040 --> 00:12:41,519
because he was exposed to this

370
00:12:39,040 --> 00:12:44,639
technology at an early age. Some things

371
00:12:41,519 --> 00:12:46,959
just are unlocked. Um, and I think that

372
00:12:44,639 --> 00:12:49,120
you're able to think differently. And I

373
00:12:46,959 --> 00:12:51,360
I'll give you a specific example of of

374
00:12:49,120 --> 00:12:53,680
what I mean here. You know, he you know,

375
00:12:51,360 --> 00:12:56,480
he goes to Python class, right? And he's

376
00:12:53,680 --> 00:12:58,160
he's coding. Now, I don't actually think

377
00:12:56,480 --> 00:12:59,760
he's going to have to code when he grows

378
00:12:58,160 --> 00:13:02,320
up. I think that's going to be a solved

379
00:12:59,760 --> 00:13:04,160
problem. But it's a very very valuable

380
00:13:02,320 --> 00:13:05,680
skill because I think learning to

381
00:13:04,160 --> 00:13:07,600
program is learning how to think

382
00:13:05,680 --> 00:13:11,360
structure in a structured way, right? In

383
00:13:07,600 --> 00:13:14,079
very semantic way, um, a systematic way.

384
00:13:11,360 --> 00:13:16,720
And you know he was he he was prompting

385
00:13:14,079 --> 00:13:18,639
uh Chachi BT with some really crazy

386
00:13:16,720 --> 00:13:21,360
things that I never even thought of. And

387
00:13:18,639 --> 00:13:24,959
one of the things was hey Chachi PT can

388
00:13:21,360 --> 00:13:27,360
you give me a sentence that has every

389
00:13:24,959 --> 00:13:30,560
letter in the alphabet

390
00:13:27,360 --> 00:13:34,160
along the theme of oceans or along the

391
00:13:30,560 --> 00:13:36,320
theme of space. And the reason this kind

392
00:13:34,160 --> 00:13:38,480
of blew my mind is because in

393
00:13:36,320 --> 00:13:40,880
traditional programming you couldn't

394
00:13:38,480 --> 00:13:43,360
write that program.

395
00:13:40,880 --> 00:13:45,279
you can't say to, you know, in in Python

396
00:13:43,360 --> 00:13:46,880
like, oh, write a function that goes and

397
00:13:45,279 --> 00:13:49,120
and formulate. I mean, it's a really

398
00:13:46,880 --> 00:13:50,880
difficult function to write, but for,

399
00:13:49,120 --> 00:13:52,720
you know, him to be able to think of

400
00:13:50,880 --> 00:13:54,480
that prompt, which is really cool

401
00:13:52,720 --> 00:13:56,160
because he built a custom GPT that you

402
00:13:54,480 --> 00:13:58,240
can type in any topic and it would give

403
00:13:56,160 --> 00:14:00,399
you a sentence that had every letter of

404
00:13:58,240 --> 00:14:02,320
the English alphabet, kind of like the

405
00:14:00,399 --> 00:14:05,440
uh the quick brown fox jumped over the

406
00:14:02,320 --> 00:14:07,760
lazy dog, right? Like, isn't that

407
00:14:05,440 --> 00:14:09,600
mind-blowing? It's like that that he can

408
00:14:07,760 --> 00:14:12,240
now at age nine he could think about

409
00:14:09,600 --> 00:14:14,160
that whereas me at age nine I was

410
00:14:12,240 --> 00:14:17,760
playing with Legos and like maybe Q

411
00:14:14,160 --> 00:14:20,079
basic right and so this idea of how

412
00:14:17,760 --> 00:14:22,480
young humans brains will evolve because

413
00:14:20,079 --> 00:14:23,920
of this new tool we have is going to

414
00:14:22,480 --> 00:14:26,399
change the way I think we're going to do

415
00:14:23,920 --> 00:14:28,000
education right and I'll be very honest

416
00:14:26,399 --> 00:14:30,880
I'm not an expert in education but I

417
00:14:28,000 --> 00:14:32,240
just thought a lot about it and you know

418
00:14:30,880 --> 00:14:33,680
one one thing I'm going to be I think

419
00:14:32,240 --> 00:14:35,920
it's going to be really important in the

420
00:14:33,680 --> 00:14:38,240
future is being able to figure out how

421
00:14:35,920 --> 00:14:41,519
ask the right questions. you know, we

422
00:14:38,240 --> 00:14:43,839
humans are in inherently inquisitive,

423
00:14:41,519 --> 00:14:45,760
but you know, being inquisitive and

424
00:14:43,839 --> 00:14:48,160
turning that into the right questions

425
00:14:45,760 --> 00:14:49,519
to, you know, prompt or ask AI, which is

426
00:14:48,160 --> 00:14:51,760
going to be again something that

427
00:14:49,519 --> 00:14:54,160
everyone's going to have access to, is

428
00:14:51,760 --> 00:14:56,800
going to be a a differentiator for sort

429
00:14:54,160 --> 00:14:59,760
of what kind of work can be done, right?

430
00:14:56,800 --> 00:15:02,480
And I I I I um the the analogy I'll draw

431
00:14:59,760 --> 00:15:04,560
is when when the calculator was

432
00:15:02,480 --> 00:15:07,440
invented, you know, people didn't stop

433
00:15:04,560 --> 00:15:11,680
doing math, right? They just did higher

434
00:15:07,440 --> 00:15:14,639
level math and it frees the mind up to

435
00:15:11,680 --> 00:15:17,760
do other things and think more at a at a

436
00:15:14,639 --> 00:15:19,519
higher level of abstraction. And I think

437
00:15:17,760 --> 00:15:21,440
we got to prepare our kids on thinking

438
00:15:19,519 --> 00:15:23,360
about well how do you think at a higher

439
00:15:21,440 --> 00:15:26,240
level of abstraction and this has

440
00:15:23,360 --> 00:15:28,399
happened before right I think Google has

441
00:15:26,240 --> 00:15:30,079
made memory kind of obsolete like you

442
00:15:28,399 --> 00:15:33,519
don't have to memorize facts anymore you

443
00:15:30,079 --> 00:15:36,480
can just Google it right and the next

444
00:15:33,519 --> 00:15:40,240
phase will be something around well code

445
00:15:36,480 --> 00:15:42,320
will just appear if you summon it so

446
00:15:40,240 --> 00:15:44,000
what are the things that you know people

447
00:15:42,320 --> 00:15:46,399
will think about and the skills that

448
00:15:44,000 --> 00:15:48,560
develop that are at the next level of

449
00:15:46,399 --> 00:15:52,720
abstraction right that tap into our

450
00:15:48,560 --> 00:15:54,000
creativity that tap into our curiosity

451
00:15:52,720 --> 00:15:56,880
that's going to be really interesting.

452
00:15:54,000 --> 00:15:59,680
So I think education is going to change

453
00:15:56,880 --> 00:16:01,600
dramatically just like how progressive

454
00:15:59,680 --> 00:16:03,440
education in the past switch from

455
00:16:01,600 --> 00:16:05,360
memorization of like multiplication

456
00:16:03,440 --> 00:16:07,920
tables into something that's a little

457
00:16:05,360 --> 00:16:09,839
bit more you know kind of higher level

458
00:16:07,920 --> 00:16:10,959
um higher level thinking and I think

459
00:16:09,839 --> 00:16:12,959
that's going to that's going to be one

460
00:16:10,959 --> 00:16:14,399
of those big areas. M this makes me

461
00:16:12,959 --> 00:16:15,920
think about an NPR story I was just

462
00:16:14,399 --> 00:16:18,000
listening to where they were following

463
00:16:15,920 --> 00:16:19,120
professors using chat GPT to create

464
00:16:18,000 --> 00:16:21,120
their curriculum. There's a lot of talk

465
00:16:19,120 --> 00:16:23,279
of students using chat GPT cheating you

466
00:16:21,120 --> 00:16:25,199
know having chat GBT write their essays

467
00:16:23,279 --> 00:16:28,399
but teachers are using chatg in a big

468
00:16:25,199 --> 00:16:30,560
way and and then uh students are rating

469
00:16:28,399 --> 00:16:31,920
professors uh badly because they notice

470
00:16:30,560 --> 00:16:33,360
they're using chat GBT for their

471
00:16:31,920 --> 00:16:35,680
curriculum. So it's kind of this like

472
00:16:33,360 --> 00:16:37,199
arms race. Well, well, but it's also

473
00:16:35,680 --> 00:16:39,040
interesting because then that's that

474
00:16:37,199 --> 00:16:41,440
goes further show further that like you

475
00:16:39,040 --> 00:16:43,519
know the whole system has to change,

476
00:16:41,440 --> 00:16:45,759
right? Because again I still believe

477
00:16:43,519 --> 00:16:47,839
that human brains are in inherently

478
00:16:45,759 --> 00:16:50,240
inquisitive and that we still need

479
00:16:47,839 --> 00:16:52,320
development in some way but how that's

480
00:16:50,240 --> 00:16:54,079
going to develop I'm I'm fascinated to

481
00:16:52,320 --> 00:16:55,519
watch how that plays out. I want to get

482
00:16:54,079 --> 00:16:57,040
back to product but first of all I know

483
00:16:55,519 --> 00:16:58,959
something that uh you think a lot about

484
00:16:57,040 --> 00:17:00,639
along these lines. This came up in many

485
00:16:58,959 --> 00:17:03,360
conversations I had with folks that you

486
00:17:00,639 --> 00:17:05,120
worked with is your uh emphasis on the

487
00:17:03,360 --> 00:17:07,600
power and importance of language being

488
00:17:05,120 --> 00:17:09,679
really good at thinking about the words

489
00:17:07,600 --> 00:17:11,199
you use both in writing and speaking.

490
00:17:09,679 --> 00:17:12,319
Just talk about how you think about that

491
00:17:11,199 --> 00:17:14,640
just the importance and power of

492
00:17:12,319 --> 00:17:16,880
language as a leader. I remember taking

493
00:17:14,640 --> 00:17:18,480
this class that really stuck with me in

494
00:17:16,880 --> 00:17:21,039
college. It was called language and

495
00:17:18,480 --> 00:17:24,079
thought um and it was taught by Herbert

496
00:17:21,039 --> 00:17:27,199
Clark and he had this thesis that kind

497
00:17:24,079 --> 00:17:29,200
of blew my mind which is that you know

498
00:17:27,199 --> 00:17:30,640
language actually affects the way you

499
00:17:29,200 --> 00:17:34,480
think. That's one of the parts of the

500
00:17:30,640 --> 00:17:36,000
thesis and I once I heard that and read

501
00:17:34,480 --> 00:17:38,000
that in his book and listened to the

502
00:17:36,000 --> 00:17:41,200
lecture I couldn't stop thinking about

503
00:17:38,000 --> 00:17:43,520
that because it just rang so true.

504
00:17:41,200 --> 00:17:45,120
Right? I grew up speaking Chinese and I

505
00:17:43,520 --> 00:17:47,840
think that there's a lot of things of

506
00:17:45,120 --> 00:17:50,480
just the Chinese language that, you

507
00:17:47,840 --> 00:17:52,400
know, I feel like I noticed I thought

508
00:17:50,480 --> 00:17:54,320
differently when I learned English,

509
00:17:52,400 --> 00:17:56,080
right? And there were some studies

510
00:17:54,320 --> 00:17:59,120
around this too. I think that there's I

511
00:17:56,080 --> 00:18:01,200
think in in in I I'm not sure exactly. I

512
00:17:59,120 --> 00:18:02,799
have to go check up on this, but I think

513
00:18:01,200 --> 00:18:04,880
in Russian there there are two different

514
00:18:02,799 --> 00:18:06,720
words for like a blue. There's like a

515
00:18:04,880 --> 00:18:09,200
greenish blue and a bright blue or

516
00:18:06,720 --> 00:18:12,480
something. I speak Russian. Uh, and I my

517
00:18:09,200 --> 00:18:14,080
but it's like uh I was I I moved to the

518
00:18:12,480 --> 00:18:15,760
US when I was six and so my Russian is

519
00:18:14,080 --> 00:18:17,520
not great. So I'm trying to think of

520
00:18:15,760 --> 00:18:19,200
this as you say it, but keep keep going.

521
00:18:17,520 --> 00:18:21,280
Well, I mean I So So then this is great.

522
00:18:19,200 --> 00:18:23,840
So I I I need to get a way to to to to

523
00:18:21,280 --> 00:18:25,679
validate this. But you know, from what I

524
00:18:23,840 --> 00:18:27,039
remember because there were these two

525
00:18:25,679 --> 00:18:29,280
different words for this different

526
00:18:27,039 --> 00:18:31,840
shades of blue. Russian speakers who

527
00:18:29,280 --> 00:18:34,240
then learned English had an easier time

528
00:18:31,840 --> 00:18:37,679
distinguishing between these two shades

529
00:18:34,240 --> 00:18:39,520
of blue than and a faster time doing so

530
00:18:37,679 --> 00:18:41,440
than people who had just grown up

531
00:18:39,520 --> 00:18:43,200
speaking English. Um, so I read some

532
00:18:41,440 --> 00:18:45,919
studies on also there's some other

533
00:18:43,200 --> 00:18:48,000
languages that don't actually have a

534
00:18:45,919 --> 00:18:49,440
word for blue I think and then that's

535
00:18:48,000 --> 00:18:51,280
actually really hard for them to

536
00:18:49,440 --> 00:18:54,000
distinguish over time. So that really

537
00:18:51,280 --> 00:18:56,000
stuck with me and and I think that it's

538
00:18:54,000 --> 00:18:58,160
kind of rings true. So when I, you know,

539
00:18:56,000 --> 00:18:59,679
how I put it in practice is that when I

540
00:18:58,160 --> 00:19:03,520
make slide decks, I gave a presentation

541
00:18:59,679 --> 00:19:05,840
to a class a couple weeks ago and there

542
00:19:03,520 --> 00:19:08,480
were probably a total of 20 words on the

543
00:19:05,840 --> 00:19:10,240
entire slide deck and I spent hours

544
00:19:08,480 --> 00:19:12,080
obsessing over them because I really

545
00:19:10,240 --> 00:19:15,280
wanted to make sure I captured the right

546
00:19:12,080 --> 00:19:16,799
essence of what I was trying to say. And

547
00:19:15,280 --> 00:19:18,559
I think that crafting is really

548
00:19:16,799 --> 00:19:20,400
important when you're working in product

549
00:19:18,559 --> 00:19:22,400
because if you're sitting down and

550
00:19:20,400 --> 00:19:25,440
you're writing a vision doc or you're

551
00:19:22,400 --> 00:19:26,880
writing a PRD and you if you don't pay

552
00:19:25,440 --> 00:19:28,799
attention to the words you use and

553
00:19:26,880 --> 00:19:30,480
you're not intentional about it, those

554
00:19:28,799 --> 00:19:32,400
have downstream effects. Like people

555
00:19:30,480 --> 00:19:34,799
might misinterpret things, the

556
00:19:32,400 --> 00:19:37,280
connotations may not actually come

557
00:19:34,799 --> 00:19:38,720
through. And so I I really am very

558
00:19:37,280 --> 00:19:41,200
careful about it because I think that

559
00:19:38,720 --> 00:19:43,520
the there's a multiplicative effect and

560
00:19:41,200 --> 00:19:47,600
a downstream effect for using the wrong

561
00:19:43,520 --> 00:19:49,840
word. Um and I I I really believe in

562
00:19:47,600 --> 00:19:52,640
that kind of language affecting thought

563
00:19:49,840 --> 00:19:55,280
um thesis which is why I've just really

564
00:19:52,640 --> 00:19:56,960
really paid attention to that. Yeah. And

565
00:19:55,280 --> 00:20:00,000
I I feel like AI can help you with that

566
00:19:56,960 --> 00:20:01,120
too. Yes. Well, actually speaking of AI,

567
00:20:00,000 --> 00:20:03,120
actually that's a really interesting

568
00:20:01,120 --> 00:20:04,799
point. I think it's really interesting

569
00:20:03,120 --> 00:20:07,120
and kind of poetic that and and and

570
00:20:04,799 --> 00:20:09,200
fitting that uh the breakthrough in

571
00:20:07,120 --> 00:20:13,280
artificial intelligence came from large

572
00:20:09,200 --> 00:20:14,880
language models, right? Like that's it's

573
00:20:13,280 --> 00:20:16,640
interesting to me because you know

574
00:20:14,880 --> 00:20:19,039
there's with every word in every

575
00:20:16,640 --> 00:20:22,559
sentence so much of the knowledge is

576
00:20:19,039 --> 00:20:24,960
encapsulated and shaped and when chatbt

577
00:20:22,559 --> 00:20:26,320
does something really interesting I I

578
00:20:24,960 --> 00:20:28,480
tell people it's often times just

579
00:20:26,320 --> 00:20:31,440
writing Python code and interpreting it

580
00:20:28,480 --> 00:20:32,960
and Python is a language yet again right

581
00:20:31,440 --> 00:20:35,039
so I think that there's something really

582
00:20:32,960 --> 00:20:38,080
interesting where like the condensation

583
00:20:35,039 --> 00:20:40,400
of human thought in language has is

584
00:20:38,080 --> 00:20:42,080
related to the LLMs and the advancements

585
00:20:40,400 --> 00:20:45,280
in area that we have today. I think it

586
00:20:42,080 --> 00:20:48,159
was Ilia on Dorash's podcast where he

587
00:20:45,280 --> 00:20:49,600
was talking about how you may think LLMs

588
00:20:48,159 --> 00:20:51,840
are just like, oh, just predicting the

589
00:20:49,600 --> 00:20:53,440
next word. What's the big deal? But in

590
00:20:51,840 --> 00:20:56,000
order to do that, it has to understand

591
00:20:53,440 --> 00:20:57,600
the universe and everything in the world

592
00:20:56,000 --> 00:20:59,280
that has ever happened and existed and

593
00:20:57,600 --> 00:21:02,080
everything anyone's ever written to

594
00:20:59,280 --> 00:21:04,320
predict the next word. Yeah. Love it.

595
00:21:02,080 --> 00:21:05,840
Yeah. Okay. So, let me let me zoom out a

596
00:21:04,320 --> 00:21:08,400
little bit and shift a little bit to

597
00:21:05,840 --> 00:21:10,720
just product in general. Sure. You've

598
00:21:08,400 --> 00:21:13,039
worked on at and built some of the most

599
00:21:10,720 --> 00:21:14,960
iconic products in history. You worked

600
00:21:13,039 --> 00:21:16,880
at OpenAI, Facebook, Uber, had a product

601
00:21:14,960 --> 00:21:18,720
at Instagram. So, let me just ask you

602
00:21:16,880 --> 00:21:20,640
this question and see where this goes.

603
00:21:18,720 --> 00:21:22,559
What's the most counterintuitive lesson

604
00:21:20,640 --> 00:21:25,039
you've learned about building products

605
00:21:22,559 --> 00:21:29,039
or leading teams that goes against

606
00:21:25,039 --> 00:21:31,039
common wisdom? I think one thing that

607
00:21:29,039 --> 00:21:35,039
it's a really hard lesson that I learned

608
00:21:31,039 --> 00:21:37,919
at Uber, uh, which is sometimes your

609
00:21:35,039 --> 00:21:39,919
product actually doesn't matter.

610
00:21:37,919 --> 00:21:41,760
And by product I mean kind of the pixels

611
00:21:39,919 --> 00:21:44,480
you put on the screen or things that you

612
00:21:41,760 --> 00:21:48,400
build in your in your in your um uh

613
00:21:44,480 --> 00:21:50,559
mobile app. Um and at Uber I learned

614
00:21:48,400 --> 00:21:52,640
this because you know it it it pains me

615
00:21:50,559 --> 00:21:56,480
to say this but really like the price

616
00:21:52,640 --> 00:21:59,440
and the ETA at Uber was the product. And

617
00:21:56,480 --> 00:22:02,000
I think a lot of times, you know, people

618
00:21:59,440 --> 00:22:04,799
at tech companies think of the product

619
00:22:02,000 --> 00:22:06,240
as just this digital manifestation, but

620
00:22:04,799 --> 00:22:08,720
looking at it from a holistic

621
00:22:06,240 --> 00:22:11,120
perspective, you know, we humans consume

622
00:22:08,720 --> 00:22:12,320
the entirety of the product. And I think

623
00:22:11,120 --> 00:22:13,760
that's that was one of the things that I

624
00:22:12,320 --> 00:22:15,280
I learned, the lessons I learned that

625
00:22:13,760 --> 00:22:17,600
was like really kind of hard-hitting,

626
00:22:15,280 --> 00:22:19,200
right? That um sometimes the pixels

627
00:22:17,600 --> 00:22:21,679
don't matter as much as you think,

628
00:22:19,200 --> 00:22:22,880
right? And you fix a certain bug. Um,

629
00:22:21,679 --> 00:22:24,720
it's not to say that you shouldn't fix

630
00:22:22,880 --> 00:22:26,720
the bug, but it doesn't have as much of

631
00:22:24,720 --> 00:22:29,120
an impact as something that is more

632
00:22:26,720 --> 00:22:32,480
important to people like a price or in

633
00:22:29,120 --> 00:22:35,520
TA. This happens a lot in, you know, B2B

634
00:22:32,480 --> 00:22:37,520
products where it's uh not just about,

635
00:22:35,520 --> 00:22:39,840
you know, how uh it's great that your

636
00:22:37,520 --> 00:22:41,919
product is is well-loved by its end

637
00:22:39,840 --> 00:22:44,320
users, but you know, does it make good

638
00:22:41,919 --> 00:22:46,000
business sense is one of those those

639
00:22:44,320 --> 00:22:47,520
hard lessons I learned as a very uh

640
00:22:46,000 --> 00:22:50,320
brighteyed, bushy tailed sort of

641
00:22:47,520 --> 00:22:52,880
designbased uh product manager uh going

642
00:22:50,320 --> 00:22:55,679
into Uber. I think the other insight

643
00:22:52,880 --> 00:22:57,919
that I had or rather other thought I had

644
00:22:55,679 --> 00:23:00,720
the other day was just the idea that

645
00:22:57,919 --> 00:23:03,200
like so many of the tech companies today

646
00:23:00,720 --> 00:23:05,200
this is kind of counterintuitive

647
00:23:03,200 --> 00:23:07,679
so many of the tech companies that are

648
00:23:05,200 --> 00:23:10,960
most valuable today didn't really start

649
00:23:07,679 --> 00:23:12,480
with any technological breakthrough

650
00:23:10,960 --> 00:23:13,760
they were built on some kind of

651
00:23:12,480 --> 00:23:16,799
technological breakthrough and they

652
00:23:13,760 --> 00:23:19,039
ended up building a lot more technology

653
00:23:16,799 --> 00:23:20,640
but really a lot of these companies like

654
00:23:19,039 --> 00:23:23,280
Facebook for example just put in the

655
00:23:20,640 --> 00:23:26,000
hard work, right? The elbow grease to

656
00:23:23,280 --> 00:23:28,240
especially in the early stages to take,

657
00:23:26,000 --> 00:23:30,000
you know, essentially a database of

658
00:23:28,240 --> 00:23:31,679
human connections and build something

659
00:23:30,000 --> 00:23:33,520
valuable on top of it and that keep on

660
00:23:31,679 --> 00:23:35,120
polishing and iterating that product and

661
00:23:33,520 --> 00:23:38,000
and coming up with new ones like

662
00:23:35,120 --> 00:23:39,679
newsfeed and photo tagging were just,

663
00:23:38,000 --> 00:23:42,000
you know, kind of came out of just

664
00:23:39,679 --> 00:23:45,120
really paying attention to what people

665
00:23:42,000 --> 00:23:47,600
wanted. And some of the ideas are super

666
00:23:45,120 --> 00:23:50,320
simple and it's not something that came

667
00:23:47,600 --> 00:23:53,120
out of the lab, right? So Uber, for

668
00:23:50,320 --> 00:23:56,480
example, took the fact that everyone had

669
00:23:53,120 --> 00:23:58,720
these GPS devices in their pockets and

670
00:23:56,480 --> 00:24:00,720
they didn't invent the GPS device, but

671
00:23:58,720 --> 00:24:03,280
they were able to take that and the fact

672
00:24:00,720 --> 00:24:06,320
that people had cars and people wanted

673
00:24:03,280 --> 00:24:07,840
to kind of um, you know, get around and

674
00:24:06,320 --> 00:24:09,679
there was a human need and they just put

675
00:24:07,840 --> 00:24:12,960
the connected the dots and put

676
00:24:09,679 --> 00:24:17,279
everything together um, and eventually

677
00:24:12,960 --> 00:24:19,039
built a ton of tech to predict the right

678
00:24:17,279 --> 00:24:22,320
marketplace and pricing.

679
00:24:19,039 --> 00:24:25,679
etc. But largely like that's a very

680
00:24:22,320 --> 00:24:27,600
valuable tech company, but it's largely

681
00:24:25,679 --> 00:24:29,120
an operations company. And I I want to

682
00:24:27,600 --> 00:24:31,520
give a huge shout out to my colleagues

683
00:24:29,120 --> 00:24:35,120
there who run, you know, kind of Uber

684
00:24:31,520 --> 00:24:36,880
Eats and and Uber uh rides from a from a

685
00:24:35,120 --> 00:24:39,840
operations perspective because truly

686
00:24:36,880 --> 00:24:41,919
like that was one of the biggest kind of

687
00:24:39,840 --> 00:24:44,240
business model hacks that I've seen,

688
00:24:41,919 --> 00:24:45,679
right? And so I I think that's you know

689
00:24:44,240 --> 00:24:48,159
Silicon Valley gets lost a thought it's

690
00:24:45,679 --> 00:24:49,520
like, oh, this is a new tech company.

691
00:24:48,159 --> 00:24:51,840
Often times, some of the most valuable

692
00:24:49,520 --> 00:24:53,520
ones are just the ones that are just

693
00:24:51,840 --> 00:24:55,840
building what people need on top of

694
00:24:53,520 --> 00:24:58,159
existing tech. This is such there's so

695
00:24:55,840 --> 00:25:00,080
much to say here. I I love it. Uh and

696
00:24:58,159 --> 00:25:02,960
this is coming from someone that led the

697
00:25:00,080 --> 00:25:04,320
Uber writer product team uh and worked

698
00:25:02,960 --> 00:25:05,360
at Facebook and head of product

699
00:25:04,320 --> 00:25:06,960
Instagram. You know, it's like it means

700
00:25:05,360 --> 00:25:08,880
a lot coming from someone like you, not

701
00:25:06,960 --> 00:25:10,559
someone, you know, that's like not in

702
00:25:08,880 --> 00:25:11,840
product especially. Yeah. I mean, I'm

703
00:25:10,559 --> 00:25:13,600
just to go further on the Instagram

704
00:25:11,840 --> 00:25:15,279
part, like it's the the idea was super

705
00:25:13,600 --> 00:25:19,039
simple. It was it was showing photos and

706
00:25:15,279 --> 00:25:22,960
and visual sharing, but the craft that

707
00:25:19,039 --> 00:25:26,320
Mike and Kevin had in putting in the

708
00:25:22,960 --> 00:25:28,400
hard work to get the product just right,

709
00:25:26,320 --> 00:25:30,000
that's what made it really take off,

710
00:25:28,400 --> 00:25:32,080
right? That's a great example. I I'd

711
00:25:30,000 --> 00:25:34,559
forgotten about Instagram. Um, but uh

712
00:25:32,080 --> 00:25:36,400
how could I? But, you know, it wasn't

713
00:25:34,559 --> 00:25:39,200
anything that any other company couldn't

714
00:25:36,400 --> 00:25:42,880
have done, but it was that product taste

715
00:25:39,200 --> 00:25:45,279
that Kevin and Mike had and conviction

716
00:25:42,880 --> 00:25:47,679
that there's a certain sort of vibe, if

717
00:25:45,279 --> 00:25:50,000
you will, uh, that people wanted and

718
00:25:47,679 --> 00:25:51,679
building that and iterating. I mean, and

719
00:25:50,000 --> 00:25:53,360
look at it now. It's it's a it's a core

720
00:25:51,679 --> 00:25:55,279
part of our lives. Visual sharing, they

721
00:25:53,360 --> 00:25:57,840
really solved it. Yeah. I just had Mike

722
00:25:55,279 --> 00:25:59,840
Greger on the podcast. Um, so it's

723
00:25:57,840 --> 00:26:02,799
interesting. There's two tensions here.

724
00:25:59,840 --> 00:26:04,640
One is just like the product doesn't

725
00:26:02,799 --> 00:26:07,279
matter in a lot of really successful

726
00:26:04,640 --> 00:26:09,679
companies. It's secondary to the cars,

727
00:26:07,279 --> 00:26:12,080
the drivers, the the GPS and the phone.

728
00:26:09,679 --> 00:26:13,520
And then on the other hand, uh techn

729
00:26:12,080 --> 00:26:14,720
there doesn't need to be a technological

730
00:26:13,520 --> 00:26:17,679
breakthrough for to build a huge

731
00:26:14,720 --> 00:26:20,320
business. is there it's almost like if

732
00:26:17,679 --> 00:26:22,960
the uh if there's no technological

733
00:26:20,320 --> 00:26:24,480
breakthrough then the product matters

734
00:26:22,960 --> 00:26:26,720
like Facebook as an example basically

735
00:26:24,480 --> 00:26:28,400
it's like a database of connections but

736
00:26:26,720 --> 00:26:30,640
what allowed and Instagram what allowed

737
00:26:28,400 --> 00:26:32,880
them to be breakthrough and there's you

738
00:26:30,640 --> 00:26:34,720
know classically competitors at the time

739
00:26:32,880 --> 00:26:37,039
uh was the experience was a lot better

740
00:26:34,720 --> 00:26:38,559
and then maybe on the flip side if the

741
00:26:37,039 --> 00:26:39,679
if the experience doesn't matter then

742
00:26:38,559 --> 00:26:41,520
it's the breakthrough is on the

743
00:26:39,679 --> 00:26:42,880
operations and other does that resonate

744
00:26:41,520 --> 00:26:45,039
is that kind of what you're saying it

745
00:26:42,880 --> 00:26:46,400
does resonate I think I think both have

746
00:26:45,039 --> 00:26:48,799
to be true. But also I would say that

747
00:26:46,400 --> 00:26:50,640
like even if you did found a company

748
00:26:48,799 --> 00:26:53,279
that has a huge technological

749
00:26:50,640 --> 00:26:55,520
breakthrough uh very shortly I think

750
00:26:53,279 --> 00:26:57,440
that you know kind of the the product

751
00:26:55,520 --> 00:26:59,279
experience will start mattering right

752
00:26:57,440 --> 00:27:01,679
because you know how long does that

753
00:26:59,279 --> 00:27:04,000
technological advantage last right

754
00:27:01,679 --> 00:27:05,679
before humans wisen up to be like well

755
00:27:04,000 --> 00:27:06,799
this is not the product I want to use I

756
00:27:05,679 --> 00:27:09,440
want to use it a little bit differently

757
00:27:06,799 --> 00:27:11,600
and this is more ergonomic for me etc.

758
00:27:09,440 --> 00:27:14,240
So I think I think that that's what you

759
00:27:11,600 --> 00:27:16,559
said is is is a beautiful summary. I I

760
00:27:14,240 --> 00:27:18,640
also think that a point in time in a

761
00:27:16,559 --> 00:27:20,720
company's history will also determine

762
00:27:18,640 --> 00:27:22,240
what is going to be more important. This

763
00:27:20,720 --> 00:27:24,320
this is especially interesting for

764
00:27:22,240 --> 00:27:26,480
companies building on top of LLMs and AI

765
00:27:24,320 --> 00:27:27,919
infrastructure where you're essentially

766
00:27:26,480 --> 00:27:30,240
saying you don't need to have some kind

767
00:27:27,919 --> 00:27:32,799
of technological breakthrough to build

768
00:27:30,240 --> 00:27:34,640
something valuable if you can create a

769
00:27:32,799 --> 00:27:36,720
really special unique experience that

770
00:27:34,640 --> 00:27:38,320
unlocks the potential of this super

771
00:27:36,720 --> 00:27:40,159
intelligence. I think that's right and

772
00:27:38,320 --> 00:27:41,840
and I have some more thoughts on just

773
00:27:40,159 --> 00:27:43,679
sort of the companies that are building

774
00:27:41,840 --> 00:27:44,960
on top of LLMs that are just you know

775
00:27:43,679 --> 00:27:47,120
that's a slightly different thing I

776
00:27:44,960 --> 00:27:49,039
would say I think that for them you know

777
00:27:47,120 --> 00:27:50,960
having the right data and the right data

778
00:27:49,039 --> 00:27:53,919
flywheels is so important like

779
00:27:50,960 --> 00:27:55,840
proprietary data especially exactly um

780
00:27:53,919 --> 00:27:57,200
and the flywheel part is is is just you

781
00:27:55,840 --> 00:27:58,799
know you can start with proprietary data

782
00:27:57,200 --> 00:28:00,559
but the flywheel is really just sort of

783
00:27:58,799 --> 00:28:02,480
how do you continue to maintain that and

784
00:28:00,559 --> 00:28:04,240
generate that and the second thing is

785
00:28:02,480 --> 00:28:06,399
again it's it's the workflow so it's the

786
00:28:04,240 --> 00:28:08,320
it's the ergonomics of how does it

787
00:28:06,399 --> 00:28:10,320
actually integrate into people's lives

788
00:28:08,320 --> 00:28:11,760
and that is going to be more and more

789
00:28:10,320 --> 00:28:12,880
important. Let's actually spend more

790
00:28:11,760 --> 00:28:14,399
time there because a lot of people are

791
00:28:12,880 --> 00:28:15,840
thinking about this. Feels like feels

792
00:28:14,399 --> 00:28:17,919
like everybody's trying to start a

793
00:28:15,840 --> 00:28:21,120
company these days with you know AI

794
00:28:17,919 --> 00:28:22,320
enabling so much more and so I think a

795
00:28:21,120 --> 00:28:23,919
lot of people are just curious where

796
00:28:22,320 --> 00:28:25,440
should they spend time and so I think

797
00:28:23,919 --> 00:28:27,200
this is actually really interesting. So

798
00:28:25,440 --> 00:28:30,080
what I'm hearing here is two things to

799
00:28:27,200 --> 00:28:32,559
think about to create any kind of mo

800
00:28:30,080 --> 00:28:34,080
defensibility against say foundational

801
00:28:32,559 --> 00:28:38,159
models coming to eat your lunch or other

802
00:28:34,080 --> 00:28:39,919
companies. uh what sort of data can you

803
00:28:38,159 --> 00:28:41,440
uh acquire that is proprietary and

804
00:28:39,919 --> 00:28:44,320
create a flywheel to generate more of

805
00:28:41,440 --> 00:28:46,159
that data and then um the other piece is

806
00:28:44,320 --> 00:28:48,559
how do you fit into a very specific like

807
00:28:46,159 --> 00:28:49,760
basically vertical that you understand

808
00:28:48,559 --> 00:28:52,000
really well that fits into their

809
00:28:49,760 --> 00:28:53,760
existing workflow. Is that right? Well,

810
00:28:52,000 --> 00:28:55,200
it's again this is this is something we

811
00:28:53,760 --> 00:28:57,760
can unpack for a long time, right?

812
00:28:55,200 --> 00:28:59,120
Because um you know with any product

813
00:28:57,760 --> 00:29:00,720
that you want to build there's going to

814
00:28:59,120 --> 00:29:02,480
be incumbents that have distribution

815
00:29:00,720 --> 00:29:04,640
advantages. But I do have this thesis

816
00:29:02,480 --> 00:29:07,520
that there are certain products that

817
00:29:04,640 --> 00:29:09,600
will be able to break through those

818
00:29:07,520 --> 00:29:11,760
advantages of the distribution of the

819
00:29:09,600 --> 00:29:14,559
other companies. Uh but you have to kind

820
00:29:11,760 --> 00:29:16,559
of overcome a pretty high bar of your

821
00:29:14,559 --> 00:29:18,159
product has to be so much better, right?

822
00:29:16,559 --> 00:29:19,440
That's I think that's that's one thing.

823
00:29:18,159 --> 00:29:21,279
But yeah, I think the data flywheel

824
00:29:19,440 --> 00:29:23,279
thing is really interesting because you

825
00:29:21,279 --> 00:29:25,360
know the the the models will get really

826
00:29:23,279 --> 00:29:26,480
good at whatever data you show it. And

827
00:29:25,360 --> 00:29:28,000
that's that's one of the things that

828
00:29:26,480 --> 00:29:30,080
people just think that AI is such a

829
00:29:28,000 --> 00:29:31,360
magic wand, but no, it's like if it's

830
00:29:30,080 --> 00:29:32,559
been trained on the right data, it's

831
00:29:31,360 --> 00:29:35,360
going to do the thing that it's been

832
00:29:32,559 --> 00:29:37,679
trained on. Um it's very malleable. Um

833
00:29:35,360 --> 00:29:39,600
so being very mindful of the data that

834
00:29:37,679 --> 00:29:43,039
you have access to to start your

835
00:29:39,600 --> 00:29:46,320
flywheel going and what you can do to

836
00:29:43,039 --> 00:29:48,880
keep on going with that flywheel is

837
00:29:46,320 --> 00:29:50,320
going to be a a critical thing for for

838
00:29:48,880 --> 00:29:51,760
anyone who's starting a company today.

839
00:29:50,320 --> 00:29:53,440
So let's make that even more specific.

840
00:29:51,760 --> 00:29:55,279
When you talk about this, I think about

841
00:29:53,440 --> 00:29:56,960
this. The CEO of Windsurf was on the

842
00:29:55,279 --> 00:29:58,399
podcast and he talked a lot about how

843
00:29:56,960 --> 00:30:01,760
they have all this really unique data

844
00:29:58,399 --> 00:30:03,760
about which recommendations of code uh

845
00:30:01,760 --> 00:30:05,200
snippets people accept and reject and

846
00:30:03,760 --> 00:30:06,880
they actually launched their own model I

847
00:30:05,200 --> 00:30:08,320
think based on that. Is that is that an

848
00:30:06,880 --> 00:30:09,840
example? Any other examples to make this

849
00:30:08,320 --> 00:30:11,360
work? That's a perfect example. Um

850
00:30:09,840 --> 00:30:13,039
there's some companies I've invested in

851
00:30:11,360 --> 00:30:16,480
that aren't public yet that have their

852
00:30:13,039 --> 00:30:18,960
own sort of take on that which is um

853
00:30:16,480 --> 00:30:22,320
really interesting to be able to uh to

854
00:30:18,960 --> 00:30:25,360
take um sort of whatever activity is in

855
00:30:22,320 --> 00:30:27,200
their product to get smarter at the

856
00:30:25,360 --> 00:30:28,480
thing that they are doing again which is

857
00:30:27,200 --> 00:30:30,799
why I think the data flywheel and the

858
00:30:28,480 --> 00:30:33,840
the the workflow go so handinand

859
00:30:30,799 --> 00:30:35,679
together right because if you are

860
00:30:33,840 --> 00:30:38,080
solving something actually valuable for

861
00:30:35,679 --> 00:30:40,559
businesses for people and there's a lot

862
00:30:38,080 --> 00:30:42,080
of that um uh attention that's being

863
00:30:40,559 --> 00:30:44,000
paid to a lot of work is being done

864
00:30:42,080 --> 00:30:46,880
through it. you're going to have that

865
00:30:44,000 --> 00:30:49,840
edge and you know this is where I see

866
00:30:46,880 --> 00:30:51,520
again startups in very different uh

867
00:30:49,840 --> 00:30:53,679
markets who have this insight who

868
00:30:51,520 --> 00:30:55,279
understand this very deeply and are not

869
00:30:53,679 --> 00:30:56,559
just trying to zero everything and be

870
00:30:55,279 --> 00:30:57,840
like no no no like this is how we're

871
00:30:56,559 --> 00:31:00,000
going to build it to make the product

872
00:30:57,840 --> 00:31:02,960
genuinely useful so that it can get

873
00:31:00,000 --> 00:31:05,120
genuinely more useful over time and that

874
00:31:02,960 --> 00:31:06,960
is going to be amazing because you know

875
00:31:05,120 --> 00:31:08,559
as a consumer of any of these products

876
00:31:06,960 --> 00:31:10,720
we're going to benefit what I'm hearing

877
00:31:08,559 --> 00:31:13,120
here is also if you don't have

878
00:31:10,720 --> 00:31:15,840
proprietary data or unique data you can

879
00:31:13,120 --> 00:31:17,520
still have a chance by building this

880
00:31:15,840 --> 00:31:19,039
flywheel where you collect that data

881
00:31:17,520 --> 00:31:21,120
through your usage. For example,

882
00:31:19,039 --> 00:31:23,039
windsurf, they all built on claude 3.5

883
00:31:21,120 --> 00:31:25,200
and then now they have all this unique

884
00:31:23,039 --> 00:31:26,640
data and now they're miles. Yeah, that's

885
00:31:25,200 --> 00:31:27,840
exactly right. And this goes back to

886
00:31:26,640 --> 00:31:30,320
sort of something I might have mentioned

887
00:31:27,840 --> 00:31:32,000
briefly, but you got to have grit when

888
00:31:30,320 --> 00:31:33,679
you're building anything, right? You got

889
00:31:32,000 --> 00:31:35,600
to be able to like have that vision,

890
00:31:33,679 --> 00:31:36,960
have that clear direction, and be able

891
00:31:35,600 --> 00:31:39,279
to really go chase that. I think that's

892
00:31:36,960 --> 00:31:41,279
really important. the and to make uh

893
00:31:39,279 --> 00:31:43,840
your example of distribution being

894
00:31:41,279 --> 00:31:46,799
overcomeable uh a a great example I

895
00:31:43,840 --> 00:31:48,399
think a lot about and we had the CPO a a

896
00:31:46,799 --> 00:31:50,240
CPO turns out there's many CPOs at

897
00:31:48,399 --> 00:31:53,039
Microsoft I didn't realize how many CPOs

898
00:31:50,240 --> 00:31:55,200
they had yeah uh and she she t I asked

899
00:31:53,039 --> 00:31:56,720
her about like why didn't co-pilot like

900
00:31:55,200 --> 00:31:58,559
the fastest growing companies in the

901
00:31:56,720 --> 00:32:00,480
world cursor winer lovable bold all

902
00:31:58,559 --> 00:32:02,960
these guys like co-pilot was so ahead of

903
00:32:00,480 --> 00:32:05,600
these these companies and and these

904
00:32:02,960 --> 00:32:08,000
companies broke through uh while

905
00:32:05,600 --> 00:32:10,000
Microsoft has distribution amazing

906
00:32:08,000 --> 00:32:12,240
talent infrastructure all the things

907
00:32:10,000 --> 00:32:13,600
early first mover advantage and it's to

908
00:32:12,240 --> 00:32:15,519
your point they were just building

909
00:32:13,600 --> 00:32:17,679
products that were much better cursor

910
00:32:15,519 --> 00:32:20,799
winds surf all these like lovable whole

911
00:32:17,679 --> 00:32:23,760
I I do believe there is a a level of

912
00:32:20,799 --> 00:32:25,760
product craft that will make it so that

913
00:32:23,760 --> 00:32:27,440
it's just worth it to switch or try

914
00:32:25,760 --> 00:32:29,360
something else and there are a few

915
00:32:27,440 --> 00:32:31,519
products out there that I see with that

916
00:32:29,360 --> 00:32:33,200
with this I think granola is one of them

917
00:32:31,519 --> 00:32:36,240
there's so many distribution advantages

918
00:32:33,200 --> 00:32:38,640
that Google meet has that Google uh

919
00:32:36,240 --> 00:32:42,080
Facebook start off. Uh Microsoft Teams

920
00:32:38,640 --> 00:32:45,279
has uh Zoom has, but they're just these

921
00:32:42,080 --> 00:32:48,480
tiny little product craft delightful

922
00:32:45,279 --> 00:32:50,720
things that I really appreciate myself

923
00:32:48,480 --> 00:32:53,440
of like, yeah, they got it. They have

924
00:32:50,720 --> 00:32:56,480
these little edges sanded down just

925
00:32:53,440 --> 00:32:59,120
right and they've really figured out a

926
00:32:56,480 --> 00:33:01,279
way to really make it so delightful that

927
00:32:59,120 --> 00:33:03,679
it's like, yeah, I will ex I will

928
00:33:01,279 --> 00:33:05,760
install this piece of software. Yes,

929
00:33:03,679 --> 00:33:08,080
100%. I will talk to my friends about

930
00:33:05,760 --> 00:33:09,919
this because it is so life-changing,

931
00:33:08,080 --> 00:33:11,919
right? And that we're starting to see

932
00:33:09,919 --> 00:33:13,279
that now. Again, before I would say 18

933
00:33:11,919 --> 00:33:15,600
months ago, it's like, oh well, who has

934
00:33:13,279 --> 00:33:17,120
the best model? But think going forward,

935
00:33:15,600 --> 00:33:18,720
it's like really who has the best

936
00:33:17,120 --> 00:33:20,880
workflow and who has the best product?

937
00:33:18,720 --> 00:33:22,559
And we humans are just demanding. We

938
00:33:20,880 --> 00:33:24,000
want the best. And so when that when

939
00:33:22,559 --> 00:33:26,240
someone is going to come out and produce

940
00:33:24,000 --> 00:33:28,000
something that's so wellcrafted, I think

941
00:33:26,240 --> 00:33:29,360
people are going to pay attention. So, a

942
00:33:28,000 --> 00:33:32,080
couple takeaways here is if you're

943
00:33:29,360 --> 00:33:33,519
trying to build an AI startup, a few uh

944
00:33:32,080 --> 00:33:35,120
things you should be thinking about that

945
00:33:33,519 --> 00:33:37,200
gives you a better chance of breaking

946
00:33:35,120 --> 00:33:38,399
through and winning is what are your

947
00:33:37,200 --> 00:33:41,039
data flywheels where you collect

948
00:33:38,399 --> 00:33:44,320
proprietary unique data. How do you

949
00:33:41,039 --> 00:33:46,320
build something that's in the craft is

950
00:33:44,320 --> 00:33:47,760
comes through and people are like wowed

951
00:33:46,320 --> 00:33:49,440
and want to tell their friends about it.

952
00:33:47,760 --> 00:33:51,440
Granola is a great example. Clearly,

953
00:33:49,440 --> 00:33:53,600
cursor, lovable, bolt, rep, all these

954
00:33:51,440 --> 00:33:55,200
guys did that. And then it feels like

955
00:33:53,600 --> 00:33:56,720
there's just like a understand a

956
00:33:55,200 --> 00:33:58,320
vertical workflow really well and then

957
00:33:56,720 --> 00:34:00,080
someone's problem and solve that in a

958
00:33:58,320 --> 00:34:02,000
really unique way. Yeah, you couldn't

959
00:34:00,080 --> 00:34:03,279
have put it better myself. Awesome. Uh

960
00:34:02,000 --> 00:34:05,360
let me ask you this because this came up

961
00:34:03,279 --> 00:34:07,600
in my chat with Mike at Enthropic. Uh

962
00:34:05,360 --> 00:34:08,960
and it's along these lines. So I I was

963
00:34:07,600 --> 00:34:10,480
thinking about just what is what is

964
00:34:08,960 --> 00:34:12,720
product doing at Anthropic? So there's

965
00:34:10,480 --> 00:34:14,399
building this basically a gigabrain

966
00:34:12,720 --> 00:34:16,720
super intelligence thing that's going to

967
00:34:14,399 --> 00:34:17,919
know everything and maybe build its own

968
00:34:16,720 --> 00:34:19,280
experience in the future. And then

969
00:34:17,919 --> 00:34:22,000
there's this like product team building

970
00:34:19,280 --> 00:34:24,320
this layer on top to interact with this

971
00:34:22,000 --> 00:34:26,800
super intelligent gigabrain. What is the

972
00:34:24,320 --> 00:34:28,720
point? What is the value of that layer?

973
00:34:26,800 --> 00:34:31,119
You spoke to it a bit here of just like

974
00:34:28,720 --> 00:34:32,800
there's value in the experience and it

975
00:34:31,119 --> 00:34:33,919
feeling native. But I guess let me just

976
00:34:32,800 --> 00:34:35,919
ask you that just where do you think

977
00:34:33,919 --> 00:34:37,280
product goes at a company like Anthropic

978
00:34:35,919 --> 00:34:39,359
OpenAI where there's just the super

979
00:34:37,280 --> 00:34:41,440
intelligence that the team is working on

980
00:34:39,359 --> 00:34:42,960
and there's this like UX on top. I think

981
00:34:41,440 --> 00:34:45,440
those companies have just such an

982
00:34:42,960 --> 00:34:48,079
advantage because you get to work in the

983
00:34:45,440 --> 00:34:50,320
same building as the researchers and I

984
00:34:48,079 --> 00:34:52,480
think that you know uh there there's

985
00:34:50,320 --> 00:34:54,000
that really kind of symbiotic

986
00:34:52,480 --> 00:34:56,800
relationship close partnership between

987
00:34:54,000 --> 00:34:59,119
post training and and um and product

988
00:34:56,800 --> 00:35:00,400
where uh you know again more and more

989
00:34:59,119 --> 00:35:02,079
it's going to be less about the raw

990
00:35:00,400 --> 00:35:03,599
intelligence. It's going to be about the

991
00:35:02,079 --> 00:35:07,680
fine-tuning

992
00:35:03,599 --> 00:35:09,920
of of what the model can do that that

993
00:35:07,680 --> 00:35:11,440
really resonates with people and what

994
00:35:09,920 --> 00:35:14,160
people want and also what the product

995
00:35:11,440 --> 00:35:14,960
trajectory is is going to be right. So I

996
00:35:14,160 --> 00:35:17,119
think that's going to you're going to

997
00:35:14,960 --> 00:35:18,560
see that more and more. I mean I think I

998
00:35:17,119 --> 00:35:20,000
think uh you know this is less about

999
00:35:18,560 --> 00:35:22,720
anthropic but more about openi. I think

1000
00:35:20,000 --> 00:35:25,119
open made a great move. Uh I am a huge

1001
00:35:22,720 --> 00:35:26,560
Fiji fan. As soon as that news leaked

1002
00:35:25,119 --> 00:35:28,320
that she was going to join I texted her

1003
00:35:26,560 --> 00:35:30,240
I was like this is great amazing

1004
00:35:28,320 --> 00:35:32,320
congratulations. I'm thrilled for her,

1005
00:35:30,240 --> 00:35:33,839
for the company, for all of my friends

1006
00:35:32,320 --> 00:35:35,520
still at opening high because it's just

1007
00:35:33,839 --> 00:35:37,599
going to be this amazing leader coming

1008
00:35:35,520 --> 00:35:38,960
in. I'm also thrilled as a consumer

1009
00:35:37,599 --> 00:35:41,200
because some great products are going to

1010
00:35:38,960 --> 00:35:43,520
come out. I think that really that close

1011
00:35:41,200 --> 00:35:44,960
tight-knit relationship between at any

1012
00:35:43,520 --> 00:35:47,599
of these large model companies between

1013
00:35:44,960 --> 00:35:50,000
post- training and and product is going

1014
00:35:47,599 --> 00:35:51,520
to produce some really incredible stuff.

1015
00:35:50,000 --> 00:35:54,720
First of all, Mike actually said very

1016
00:35:51,520 --> 00:35:56,480
similar things that the more I did not I

1017
00:35:54,720 --> 00:35:59,760
promise you I did not watch that even

1018
00:35:56,480 --> 00:36:00,960
come out yet, so I believe you. Uh yeah

1019
00:35:59,760 --> 00:36:02,880
they they he had this interesting

1020
00:36:00,960 --> 00:36:06,000
finding where he he put product people

1021
00:36:02,880 --> 00:36:08,960
on like UX product experience frontf

1022
00:36:06,000 --> 00:36:11,599
facing product and then he put PMs on

1023
00:36:08,960 --> 00:36:13,520
the research teams and building models

1024
00:36:11,599 --> 00:36:15,760
helping models get better helping

1025
00:36:13,520 --> 00:36:18,240
researchers build uh things and he found

1026
00:36:15,760 --> 00:36:19,440
that all all the leverage and wins came

1027
00:36:18,240 --> 00:36:22,240
from the PMs working with the

1028
00:36:19,440 --> 00:36:23,920
researchers much less so on the product

1029
00:36:22,240 --> 00:36:25,359
experience and so he puts more and more

1030
00:36:23,920 --> 00:36:26,880
PMs with that with that with that team.

1031
00:36:25,359 --> 00:36:28,000
I I'm so thrilled to hear that because

1032
00:36:26,880 --> 00:36:29,440
it's a little bit of it's very

1033
00:36:28,000 --> 00:36:31,599
validating because that's what we did at

1034
00:36:29,440 --> 00:36:33,839
Open AI 2 like we were very closely tied

1035
00:36:31,599 --> 00:36:35,359
to the post trading team and so it was

1036
00:36:33,839 --> 00:36:37,440
because of that tight collaboration that

1037
00:36:35,359 --> 00:36:39,440
you see some of the advances of of of

1038
00:36:37,440 --> 00:36:41,760
Chacht getting better at so many things

1039
00:36:39,440 --> 00:36:43,520
right so uh it's great it's it's awesome

1040
00:36:41,760 --> 00:36:47,119
that we independently came to the same

1041
00:36:43,520 --> 00:36:49,359
conclusion yes it's a good sign okay uh

1042
00:36:47,119 --> 00:36:50,720
so we're talking about startups building

1043
00:36:49,359 --> 00:36:52,560
new companies I want to follow this

1044
00:36:50,720 --> 00:36:55,760
thread a little bit I feel like you've

1045
00:36:52,560 --> 00:36:58,240
built more products that from zero to

1046
00:36:55,760 --> 00:37:00,079
one to scale than may maybe most anyone

1047
00:36:58,240 --> 00:37:02,079
else across all the companies that you

1048
00:37:00,079 --> 00:37:04,079
worked at. I'm gonna do a quick rundown

1049
00:37:02,079 --> 00:37:05,599
of some of the things you've done. And

1050
00:37:04,079 --> 00:37:07,760
uh I'm I'm going to miss a bunch, but

1051
00:37:05,599 --> 00:37:09,359
let's see. You built and led the

1052
00:37:07,760 --> 00:37:11,040
Facebook newsfeed, the current version

1053
00:37:09,359 --> 00:37:12,800
of it. You built the new groups

1054
00:37:11,040 --> 00:37:14,320
experience, chat, and messages. You

1055
00:37:12,800 --> 00:37:16,320
shipped the messenger app as its own

1056
00:37:14,320 --> 00:37:18,800
app. That was that was one of your

1057
00:37:16,320 --> 00:37:22,880
projects. You uh led Uber Pool, lowcost

1058
00:37:18,800 --> 00:37:25,440
rides. Uh you launched Chad GPT

1059
00:37:22,880 --> 00:37:28,079
enterprise. you shipped voice and vision

1060
00:37:25,440 --> 00:37:31,040
memory custom GPTs just refreshing the

1061
00:37:28,079 --> 00:37:32,640
whole design of chat GPT uh many more

1062
00:37:31,040 --> 00:37:35,680
things a lot of work at air table

1063
00:37:32,640 --> 00:37:37,280
obviously also uh Oculus uh these are

1064
00:37:35,680 --> 00:37:38,400
just some examples in the intro I'm

1065
00:37:37,280 --> 00:37:40,400
going to try to go through all these

1066
00:37:38,400 --> 00:37:42,480
things so all that to say I feel like

1067
00:37:40,400 --> 00:37:44,880
you've seen a lot of what works and

1068
00:37:42,480 --> 00:37:48,560
doesn't work building from idea from

1069
00:37:44,880 --> 00:37:50,640
zero essentially to one to scale

1070
00:37:48,560 --> 00:37:52,000
so let me just ask you this question

1071
00:37:50,640 --> 00:37:53,599
what's uh what's an important lesson

1072
00:37:52,000 --> 00:37:55,680
you've learned about what it takes to

1073
00:37:53,599 --> 00:37:59,440
succeed building something from idea to

1074
00:37:55,680 --> 00:38:01,200
one to billions. Yeah. Um thank you and

1075
00:37:59,440 --> 00:38:04,480
that was a good trip down memory lane

1076
00:38:01,200 --> 00:38:06,800
too. Um uh when you read that off. So I

1077
00:38:04,480 --> 00:38:09,440
think the first thing I would say and

1078
00:38:06,800 --> 00:38:12,160
you know going from zero to one is

1079
00:38:09,440 --> 00:38:15,760
different than going from one to 100

1080
00:38:12,160 --> 00:38:17,520
and when you are in the one to 100 phase

1081
00:38:15,760 --> 00:38:20,240
which is a lot of the time that I spent

1082
00:38:17,520 --> 00:38:22,800
you know is is in the one to 100 phase

1083
00:38:20,240 --> 00:38:25,920
um we you know were able to we

1084
00:38:22,800 --> 00:38:27,839
quadrupled Instagram usage in two years

1085
00:38:25,920 --> 00:38:29,440
that was very much a fun ride and

1086
00:38:27,839 --> 00:38:32,160
there's a bunch of other examples at

1087
00:38:29,440 --> 00:38:34,240
other uh at other companies but when you

1088
00:38:32,160 --> 00:38:37,119
go to one to 100 I I think one of the

1089
00:38:34,240 --> 00:38:39,599
things that you really got to take into

1090
00:38:37,119 --> 00:38:42,400
account is that you have to plan your

1091
00:38:39,599 --> 00:38:44,960
chess moves out in advance.

1092
00:38:42,400 --> 00:38:47,920
You have to really think before you act

1093
00:38:44,960 --> 00:38:50,000
and build systems that are going to let

1094
00:38:47,920 --> 00:38:51,280
you go sustainably faster because the

1095
00:38:50,000 --> 00:38:53,440
0ero to one is you're trying to find

1096
00:38:51,280 --> 00:38:55,920
that product market fit and then when

1097
00:38:53,440 --> 00:38:57,520
you get to one to 100 you're trying to

1098
00:38:55,920 --> 00:38:59,839
make sure you can get to hypers scale

1099
00:38:57,520 --> 00:39:01,839
and and as fast as you can, right? And

1100
00:38:59,839 --> 00:39:04,320
I've been very fortunate to be along the

1101
00:39:01,839 --> 00:39:05,359
ride of of many of these products as

1102
00:39:04,320 --> 00:39:07,200
they were going through that hypers

1103
00:39:05,359 --> 00:39:08,960
scale. And the analogy I always like to

1104
00:39:07,200 --> 00:39:10,720
use is that when you do that, you feel

1105
00:39:08,960 --> 00:39:12,160
the G-forces, right? And you know, some

1106
00:39:10,720 --> 00:39:14,800
people are like, "Oh, yeah, I'm a pilot.

1107
00:39:12,160 --> 00:39:16,000
I can fly at, you know, 35,000 ft." But

1108
00:39:14,800 --> 00:39:18,079
like the the, you know, feeling the

1109
00:39:16,000 --> 00:39:20,160
G-forces of takeoff of a rocket is very

1110
00:39:18,079 --> 00:39:22,079
different, right? And the thing that

1111
00:39:20,160 --> 00:39:24,079
I've learned there doing that a few

1112
00:39:22,079 --> 00:39:26,240
times is you got to build the systems

1113
00:39:24,079 --> 00:39:27,760
that help you move sustainably faster,

1114
00:39:26,240 --> 00:39:30,640
right? And sometimes you have to go slow

1115
00:39:27,760 --> 00:39:32,560
to go fast. Um, and here's an example.

1116
00:39:30,640 --> 00:39:34,640
So, in building the newsfeed, the

1117
00:39:32,560 --> 00:39:36,000
current version that we have today, it

1118
00:39:34,640 --> 00:39:38,160
really hasn't changed much from the time

1119
00:39:36,000 --> 00:39:41,359
that we uh built it. I don't even know,

1120
00:39:38,160 --> 00:39:42,400
it was like 12 years ago or something. I

1121
00:39:41,359 --> 00:39:43,760
don't know the reason why it hasn't

1122
00:39:42,400 --> 00:39:46,800
changed much, but I like to think that

1123
00:39:43,760 --> 00:39:48,960
it's because we put a lot of time and

1124
00:39:46,800 --> 00:39:51,599
craft into thinking about the whole

1125
00:39:48,960 --> 00:39:53,440
sharing loop and what are what is the uh

1126
00:39:51,599 --> 00:39:56,240
what is the what are the key pieces of

1127
00:39:53,440 --> 00:39:57,920
it and how is it architected? What's the

1128
00:39:56,240 --> 00:39:59,839
information architecture? And what does

1129
00:39:57,920 --> 00:40:01,520
that whole flow look like? How does it

1130
00:39:59,839 --> 00:40:04,560
go from posting something at the top of

1131
00:40:01,520 --> 00:40:07,040
the page to showing up in the newsfeed

1132
00:40:04,560 --> 00:40:09,040
to someone clicking like and then that

1133
00:40:07,040 --> 00:40:11,200
notifications thing lighting up red and

1134
00:40:09,040 --> 00:40:13,119
then that repeating over and over again.

1135
00:40:11,200 --> 00:40:15,040
And I like to think that newsfeed has

1136
00:40:13,119 --> 00:40:17,040
stood the test of time uh the current

1137
00:40:15,040 --> 00:40:19,280
version of it because we thought very

1138
00:40:17,040 --> 00:40:20,800
carefully about how people wanted to

1139
00:40:19,280 --> 00:40:23,040
interact and how people wanted to

1140
00:40:20,800 --> 00:40:25,680
consume information and also that whole

1141
00:40:23,040 --> 00:40:28,000
loop. Um, and so when when that happens,

1142
00:40:25,680 --> 00:40:31,440
then I think things are built to last,

1143
00:40:28,000 --> 00:40:32,640
right? And I think the this I think this

1144
00:40:31,440 --> 00:40:34,400
is the case at a lot of different

1145
00:40:32,640 --> 00:40:36,480
companies. So when I was at Uber, we we

1146
00:40:34,400 --> 00:40:38,320
had a bit of a spaghetti string code

1147
00:40:36,480 --> 00:40:39,520
situation on the writer app, but you

1148
00:40:38,320 --> 00:40:41,520
know, taking a step back and

1149
00:40:39,520 --> 00:40:43,119
rearchitecting things of like what are

1150
00:40:41,520 --> 00:40:45,359
the core components and how do you

1151
00:40:43,119 --> 00:40:48,400
actually make it so that the product

1152
00:40:45,359 --> 00:40:51,119
selector can scale around the world and

1153
00:40:48,400 --> 00:40:53,040
here's a little known fact like you know

1154
00:40:51,119 --> 00:40:54,400
talk about grit and elbow grease like

1155
00:40:53,040 --> 00:40:55,760
Uber is not just as simple as like

1156
00:40:54,400 --> 00:40:57,760
finding a ride. If you've ever been to

1157
00:40:55,760 --> 00:41:00,000
another country like in India sometimes

1158
00:40:57,760 --> 00:41:01,680
there are no street signs so you have to

1159
00:41:00,000 --> 00:41:04,000
like pick up in front of this you know

1160
00:41:01,680 --> 00:41:05,359
mini mart or whatever it might be. So

1161
00:41:04,000 --> 00:41:07,520
there's a whole team that worked on

1162
00:41:05,359 --> 00:41:09,760
pickup and drop offs. This was a large

1163
00:41:07,520 --> 00:41:12,079
effort and it sounds so boring but it

1164
00:41:09,760 --> 00:41:14,640
was so critical to Uber being able to

1165
00:41:12,079 --> 00:41:16,079
scale because pickup and drop offs team

1166
00:41:14,640 --> 00:41:18,319
thought about well how do you do it for

1167
00:41:16,079 --> 00:41:19,920
venues and that venues and finding that

1168
00:41:18,319 --> 00:41:22,880
right abstraction means that you can

1169
00:41:19,920 --> 00:41:24,880
have uh a scalable way to to do pickups

1170
00:41:22,880 --> 00:41:27,440
at airports and you know configure

1171
00:41:24,880 --> 00:41:29,359
different venues and those systems when

1172
00:41:27,440 --> 00:41:32,000
you take the time to build them in the

1173
00:41:29,359 --> 00:41:34,480
one to 100 phase

1174
00:41:32,000 --> 00:41:38,240
help you speed up massively and that's

1175
00:41:34,480 --> 00:41:40,240
how you get 4x you users in two years or

1176
00:41:38,240 --> 00:41:41,839
on messenger we put a lot of thought

1177
00:41:40,240 --> 00:41:44,079
into the infrastructure around push

1178
00:41:41,839 --> 00:41:47,280
notifications etc. We grew that product

1179
00:41:44,079 --> 00:41:49,680
from zero to 4.7 billion messages sent

1180
00:41:47,280 --> 00:41:52,240
per day uh in about two and a half

1181
00:41:49,680 --> 00:41:54,560
years. Um and I think it really is

1182
00:41:52,240 --> 00:41:56,400
requires that that forethought in in

1183
00:41:54,560 --> 00:41:57,920
building the right systems. Well, let me

1184
00:41:56,400 --> 00:41:58,880
follow that the red quickly because

1185
00:41:57,920 --> 00:42:01,119
that's really interesting. So

1186
00:41:58,880 --> 00:42:02,800
essentially what you're saying is once

1187
00:42:01,119 --> 00:42:04,240
there's like a phase of once you find

1188
00:42:02,800 --> 00:42:06,640
product market fit and I want to

1189
00:42:04,240 --> 00:42:08,480
actually ask you this uh before you

1190
00:42:06,640 --> 00:42:11,200
start planning when you're starting to

1191
00:42:08,480 --> 00:42:13,440
scale going from one to 100 your advice

1192
00:42:11,200 --> 00:42:15,680
here is basically don't move fast and

1193
00:42:13,440 --> 00:42:17,359
break things don't ship MVPs this is the

1194
00:42:15,680 --> 00:42:19,119
time to really think many chess moves

1195
00:42:17,359 --> 00:42:21,280
ahead about what you're going to need to

1196
00:42:19,119 --> 00:42:23,200
get this to say a billion users. Yeah.

1197
00:42:21,280 --> 00:42:25,119
Yeah. It's building the systems and then

1198
00:42:23,200 --> 00:42:27,200
that that systems thinking will will

1199
00:42:25,119 --> 00:42:29,040
carry you really far. At least that's

1200
00:42:27,200 --> 00:42:30,560
been my experience and hopefully

1201
00:42:29,040 --> 00:42:32,880
hopefully you can find the same way but

1202
00:42:30,560 --> 00:42:34,560
you know um your mileage may vary but

1203
00:42:32,880 --> 00:42:36,079
yeah that's exactly right. What's your

1204
00:42:34,560 --> 00:42:37,520
guidance on just like when to do that

1205
00:42:36,079 --> 00:42:39,599
because you know you can't you know you

1206
00:42:37,520 --> 00:42:41,040
build something okay well it's working

1207
00:42:39,599 --> 00:42:42,800
there's also this just like okay let's

1208
00:42:41,040 --> 00:42:45,440
just keep it going let's scale it as far

1209
00:42:42,800 --> 00:42:47,040
as we can there in your experience is it

1210
00:42:45,440 --> 00:42:48,720
just like what's the guidance on when to

1211
00:42:47,040 --> 00:42:50,560
really step back and really think years

1212
00:42:48,720 --> 00:42:51,920
and years ahead. Great question. I'll

1213
00:42:50,560 --> 00:42:53,839
say the first thing I'll say is that

1214
00:42:51,920 --> 00:42:56,960
it's not a binary switch. It's actually

1215
00:42:53,839 --> 00:42:58,560
a ramp rate. Um and so when I've led

1216
00:42:56,960 --> 00:43:00,720
teams, I've always believed strongly in

1217
00:42:58,560 --> 00:43:03,760
this portfolio approach, right? And so,

1218
00:43:00,720 --> 00:43:05,839
you know, famously Google had the 702010

1219
00:43:03,760 --> 00:43:08,160
portfolio approach. That may be the

1220
00:43:05,839 --> 00:43:10,480
right thing for a more mature company.

1221
00:43:08,160 --> 00:43:12,960
Uh maybe it's 50/50 if you're a startup,

1222
00:43:10,480 --> 00:43:15,280
right? But you have to think about this

1223
00:43:12,960 --> 00:43:17,119
in a non-binary way and in in a way

1224
00:43:15,280 --> 00:43:18,960
that's about scaling up and when do you

1225
00:43:17,119 --> 00:43:21,119
need to put more resources behind uh

1226
00:43:18,960 --> 00:43:23,760
behind that. So every startup is going

1227
00:43:21,119 --> 00:43:25,119
to be different, right? every product uh

1228
00:43:23,760 --> 00:43:27,040
that you're launching is going to be

1229
00:43:25,119 --> 00:43:28,560
different and then thinking about your

1230
00:43:27,040 --> 00:43:30,960
portfolio approach and how much you

1231
00:43:28,560 --> 00:43:32,800
allocate your time. That would be my my

1232
00:43:30,960 --> 00:43:34,480
advice and it's you're you know it's it

1233
00:43:32,800 --> 00:43:36,560
is really dependent on the stage that

1234
00:43:34,480 --> 00:43:38,640
you're in. I think that actually is a

1235
00:43:36,560 --> 00:43:41,119
nice dovetail to my second thing if I if

1236
00:43:38,640 --> 00:43:43,839
I may. Um which is uh you know when

1237
00:43:41,119 --> 00:43:46,480
you're going from that stage of of uh

1238
00:43:43,839 --> 00:43:48,640
maybe you know one to five or one to 10.

1239
00:43:46,480 --> 00:43:53,280
So not just fully one to 100. One thing

1240
00:43:48,640 --> 00:43:55,280
I found to be very helpful is to measure

1241
00:43:53,280 --> 00:43:58,480
everything. And this sounds again very

1242
00:43:55,280 --> 00:44:00,400
simple but you know just like how you

1243
00:43:58,480 --> 00:44:02,000
wouldn't fly a plane without instruments

1244
00:44:00,400 --> 00:44:03,200
like why would you run your product

1245
00:44:02,000 --> 00:44:05,839
without understanding the

1246
00:44:03,200 --> 00:44:07,839
instrumentation and uh how it's doing

1247
00:44:05,839 --> 00:44:09,599
right and so one of the things I did in

1248
00:44:07,839 --> 00:44:13,440
pretty much all the teams that I led

1249
00:44:09,599 --> 00:44:16,480
whether it was Instagram Uber air table

1250
00:44:13,440 --> 00:44:17,680
was all about and chat GPT2 uh the one

1251
00:44:16,480 --> 00:44:19,760
of the first things I did was always to

1252
00:44:17,680 --> 00:44:21,359
build a growth team and building a

1253
00:44:19,760 --> 00:44:24,079
growth team is really interesting

1254
00:44:21,359 --> 00:44:25,200
because it actually is a simple razor.

1255
00:44:24,079 --> 00:44:26,400
It's a simple thing to think about. It's

1256
00:44:25,200 --> 00:44:27,920
like I'm going to build a growth team,

1257
00:44:26,400 --> 00:44:29,839
but then you're going to uncover a lot

1258
00:44:27,920 --> 00:44:32,160
of things, right? You're going to

1259
00:44:29,839 --> 00:44:35,680
uncover how much stuff you have not yet

1260
00:44:32,160 --> 00:44:38,480
logged and how non-rigorous you've been

1261
00:44:35,680 --> 00:44:39,920
looking at your entire product. And it's

1262
00:44:38,480 --> 00:44:42,079
it's so funny because I've seen this

1263
00:44:39,920 --> 00:44:43,359
movie so many times, the same movie so

1264
00:44:42,079 --> 00:44:45,760
many times at every one of these

1265
00:44:43,359 --> 00:44:48,240
companies where I remember walking into

1266
00:44:45,760 --> 00:44:49,920
Instagram and I think asking Kevin Lex

1267
00:44:48,240 --> 00:44:52,640
like, "So, how many users do we have?"

1268
00:44:49,920 --> 00:44:54,319
It's like, "Well, we don't really know."

1269
00:44:52,640 --> 00:44:56,240
and and so it's like well there a lot

1270
00:44:54,319 --> 00:44:58,079
and we don't really know and so when you

1271
00:44:56,240 --> 00:44:59,680
build a growth team and you hire the

1272
00:44:58,079 --> 00:45:01,280
right growth leader I've had the

1273
00:44:59,680 --> 00:45:04,079
pleasure uh the the pleasure of working

1274
00:45:01,280 --> 00:45:06,720
with George Lee at Instagram um you know

1275
00:45:04,079 --> 00:45:09,920
some early growth folks at at Facebook

1276
00:45:06,720 --> 00:45:11,920
Andrew Chen air at um at Uber uh Air

1277
00:45:09,920 --> 00:45:14,480
Table um I had the privilege of working

1278
00:45:11,920 --> 00:45:16,640
with uh Lauren um who is currently now

1279
00:45:14,480 --> 00:45:17,920
leading growth at at Notion. So I've

1280
00:45:16,640 --> 00:45:20,079
I've been very fortunate to work with

1281
00:45:17,920 --> 00:45:22,319
some really amazing people on my team.

1282
00:45:20,079 --> 00:45:23,920
And when you hire the right person, they

1283
00:45:22,319 --> 00:45:26,079
start asking all the right questions

1284
00:45:23,920 --> 00:45:28,640
because when you know the archetype of

1285
00:45:26,079 --> 00:45:31,119
person who is a a growth PM will be like

1286
00:45:28,640 --> 00:45:33,040
well wait why is this happening and

1287
00:45:31,119 --> 00:45:35,040
let's get the data on X Y and Z thing

1288
00:45:33,040 --> 00:45:37,200
and that's when you realize you don't

1289
00:45:35,040 --> 00:45:39,040
have X Y and Z thing logged and after

1290
00:45:37,200 --> 00:45:40,480
you have X Y and Z thing logged you look

1291
00:45:39,040 --> 00:45:42,079
at the data you're like wait well why is

1292
00:45:40,480 --> 00:45:44,079
that happening and then you're you're

1293
00:45:42,079 --> 00:45:46,319
forcing yourself to go deeper into the

1294
00:45:44,079 --> 00:45:47,520
analysis of doing some analysis of like

1295
00:45:46,319 --> 00:45:49,599
well you know what's correlated with

1296
00:45:47,520 --> 00:45:51,440
what and what are some hypotheses And

1297
00:45:49,599 --> 00:45:54,079
because growth leaders, growth product

1298
00:45:51,440 --> 00:45:56,880
leaders are so into this experimentation

1299
00:45:54,079 --> 00:45:58,480
side, it actually is this really easy

1300
00:45:56,880 --> 00:46:00,880
thing to do is when you start building a

1301
00:45:58,480 --> 00:46:03,119
growth team, it just begets all of the

1302
00:46:00,880 --> 00:46:05,200
right questions being asked and then it

1303
00:46:03,119 --> 00:46:07,920
starts uh you know kind of turning into

1304
00:46:05,200 --> 00:46:09,520
all the right behaviors of of of taking

1305
00:46:07,920 --> 00:46:11,440
something you've been building which is

1306
00:46:09,520 --> 00:46:13,599
seems like it's working into a more

1307
00:46:11,440 --> 00:46:16,079
rigorous system. So that's like the zero

1308
00:46:13,599 --> 00:46:17,920
sorry the the 1 to 10 phase I would say

1309
00:46:16,079 --> 00:46:20,720
that really sets you up for the 10 to

1310
00:46:17,920 --> 00:46:22,800
100. What what I like about this growth

1311
00:46:20,720 --> 00:46:24,960
team advice is that a lot of people

1312
00:46:22,800 --> 00:46:26,640
think of a time to hire a growth team to

1313
00:46:24,960 --> 00:46:28,400
we need to drive growth. What you're

1314
00:46:26,640 --> 00:46:30,319
saying is there's a lot of second order

1315
00:46:28,400 --> 00:46:32,720
benefits which is they help you figure

1316
00:46:30,319 --> 00:46:34,880
out what the hell's going on and inform

1317
00:46:32,720 --> 00:46:36,000
a lot of uh of other things that are

1318
00:46:34,880 --> 00:46:37,839
happening. people just actually

1319
00:46:36,000 --> 00:46:39,520
understanding how things are going and

1320
00:46:37,839 --> 00:46:41,599
totally and I think that the reason why

1321
00:46:39,520 --> 00:46:43,119
growth team is is is the advice I would

1322
00:46:41,599 --> 00:46:45,200
go with rather than to build an

1323
00:46:43,119 --> 00:46:48,000
analytics team is because if you build

1324
00:46:45,200 --> 00:46:49,200
an analytics team or a data science team

1325
00:46:48,000 --> 00:46:51,440
it's possible that no one's going to

1326
00:46:49,200 --> 00:46:52,880
listen to them right it's like oh I have

1327
00:46:51,440 --> 00:46:54,160
these insights it's like well no one

1328
00:46:52,880 --> 00:46:56,480
really cares but if you have a if you

1329
00:46:54,160 --> 00:46:58,960
hire a growth leader they are now tied

1330
00:46:56,480 --> 00:47:00,480
to outcomes of driving growth so they're

1331
00:46:58,960 --> 00:47:03,119
going to be the ones who are listening

1332
00:47:00,480 --> 00:47:04,800
and asking you know more questions and

1333
00:47:03,119 --> 00:47:07,119
really partnering with that data science

1334
00:47:04,800 --> 00:47:09,040
team to make your entire product and

1335
00:47:07,119 --> 00:47:12,240
business more rigorous and that just

1336
00:47:09,040 --> 00:47:14,079
changes the DNA of of your entire team.

1337
00:47:12,240 --> 00:47:15,440
I want to talk about hiring but is there

1338
00:47:14,079 --> 00:47:17,839
anything else along these lines that you

1339
00:47:15,440 --> 00:47:19,839
want to share of building new product

1340
00:47:17,839 --> 00:47:22,319
scaling products? I guess the last thing

1341
00:47:19,839 --> 00:47:25,200
I would say is like I I I want to make

1342
00:47:22,319 --> 00:47:27,920
sure that you know sometimes in the um

1343
00:47:25,200 --> 00:47:30,880
in the pursuit of numbers product folks

1344
00:47:27,920 --> 00:47:34,000
lose sight of the importance of taste

1345
00:47:30,880 --> 00:47:36,000
and craft. So uh maybe this is actually

1346
00:47:34,000 --> 00:47:37,359
the dovetail into kind of building teams

1347
00:47:36,000 --> 00:47:40,160
but like you got to have the

1348
00:47:37,359 --> 00:47:41,839
counterbalances right and it's really

1349
00:47:40,160 --> 00:47:44,560
important to give two people on your

1350
00:47:41,839 --> 00:47:47,040
team different charges. One is like go

1351
00:47:44,560 --> 00:47:49,280
grow the product and the other one is

1352
00:47:47,040 --> 00:47:52,319
wait maintain that design that beautiful

1353
00:47:49,280 --> 00:47:54,000
aesthetic that that that uh the the the

1354
00:47:52,319 --> 00:47:57,440
craft that your that your product is

1355
00:47:54,000 --> 00:48:00,480
known for. And that tension is extremely

1356
00:47:57,440 --> 00:48:02,560
healthy, right? And so I I've saw I've

1357
00:48:00,480 --> 00:48:04,560
seen this at at at at Facebook. I've

1358
00:48:02,560 --> 00:48:06,079
seen this at Instagram. I I helped

1359
00:48:04,560 --> 00:48:08,240
create this at Instagram. This kind of

1360
00:48:06,079 --> 00:48:10,720
healthy tension. Air table, same thing.

1361
00:48:08,240 --> 00:48:12,640
But just having chatbt, same exact

1362
00:48:10,720 --> 00:48:15,440
thing. You have to have that push and

1363
00:48:12,640 --> 00:48:17,359
pull on both sides to really stretch the

1364
00:48:15,440 --> 00:48:18,480
gamut. That begs the question, how do

1365
00:48:17,359 --> 00:48:19,599
you actually do that? You know, a lot

1366
00:48:18,480 --> 00:48:21,440
you could talk about it. You could be

1367
00:48:19,599 --> 00:48:23,359
like, okay, we need to make sure the

1368
00:48:21,440 --> 00:48:25,119
experience is awesome, but also grow

1369
00:48:23,359 --> 00:48:26,480
this number. here's your goal. How do

1370
00:48:25,119 --> 00:48:28,160
you operationalize that as like a

1371
00:48:26,480 --> 00:48:30,240
performance review attribute thing? Is

1372
00:48:28,160 --> 00:48:31,760
it culture? Something else? As a leader,

1373
00:48:30,240 --> 00:48:35,440
you have to set up your team the right

1374
00:48:31,760 --> 00:48:38,240
way. You have to really think about your

1375
00:48:35,440 --> 00:48:41,440
team as a product and what are the

1376
00:48:38,240 --> 00:48:43,920
various pieces you need to really

1377
00:48:41,440 --> 00:48:47,839
stretch the gamut of what you're what

1378
00:48:43,920 --> 00:48:50,240
you're thinking about. Um, and the teams

1379
00:48:47,839 --> 00:48:52,640
that I've helped build

1380
00:48:50,240 --> 00:48:54,800
are the most successful ones are a team

1381
00:48:52,640 --> 00:48:55,839
of Avengers that are just like very

1382
00:48:54,800 --> 00:48:58,319
different, have very different

1383
00:48:55,839 --> 00:49:00,079
superpowers, but together you as the

1384
00:48:58,319 --> 00:49:03,040
leader are the one who's helping

1385
00:49:00,079 --> 00:49:05,119
adjudicate any differences or uh any any

1386
00:49:03,040 --> 00:49:06,720
disagreements, but you're you know

1387
00:49:05,119 --> 00:49:09,040
you're getting the best outcome when

1388
00:49:06,720 --> 00:49:11,280
everyone's pulling and obsessing over a

1389
00:49:09,040 --> 00:49:12,960
different thing, right? And that's

1390
00:49:11,280 --> 00:49:16,000
important. It's important to to create

1391
00:49:12,960 --> 00:49:17,359
your balance and and really kind of

1392
00:49:16,000 --> 00:49:20,079
increase the space that you're looking

1393
00:49:17,359 --> 00:49:21,839
at and create those healthy debates. And

1394
00:49:20,079 --> 00:49:24,319
I think a lot of people overlook that. I

1395
00:49:21,839 --> 00:49:26,480
think some people think of, you know,

1396
00:49:24,319 --> 00:49:29,280
people on a team as like warm bodies to

1397
00:49:26,480 --> 00:49:31,040
do a job, but my philosophy has always

1398
00:49:29,280 --> 00:49:33,760
been to think about what is the what

1399
00:49:31,040 --> 00:49:36,079
does the company need to be successful

1400
00:49:33,760 --> 00:49:39,119
and who's the best person who spikes at

1401
00:49:36,079 --> 00:49:41,040
that one thing and how do I make sure

1402
00:49:39,119 --> 00:49:42,720
that that we get that person and how do

1403
00:49:41,040 --> 00:49:44,240
we make sure we get the other person and

1404
00:49:42,720 --> 00:49:46,000
the other person? It's almost like

1405
00:49:44,240 --> 00:49:47,839
you're playing an RPG where everyone has

1406
00:49:46,000 --> 00:49:49,760
different sliders and you have to create

1407
00:49:47,839 --> 00:49:51,920
this super team where everyone actually

1408
00:49:49,760 --> 00:49:54,800
spikes in different in different ways.

1409
00:49:51,920 --> 00:49:56,800
And that is some thing that I've had a

1410
00:49:54,800 --> 00:49:59,119
lot of success with in terms of when you

1411
00:49:56,800 --> 00:50:01,520
create that environment and you create

1412
00:49:59,119 --> 00:50:03,359
that uh vibe, you're going to get a lot

1413
00:50:01,520 --> 00:50:04,720
of mileage out of that team. That is a

1414
00:50:03,359 --> 00:50:06,559
really interesting answer. It's not one

1415
00:50:04,720 --> 00:50:08,400
I've heard before. Essentially, you're

1416
00:50:06,559 --> 00:50:11,839
it's not like create the right

1417
00:50:08,400 --> 00:50:14,559
incentives. It's hire people that

1418
00:50:11,839 --> 00:50:16,880
naturally want us see the world in a

1419
00:50:14,559 --> 00:50:19,200
certain way and that creates a balance

1420
00:50:16,880 --> 00:50:22,160
and tension a healthy tension between

1421
00:50:19,200 --> 00:50:23,520
say a PM and a designer and an engineer

1422
00:50:22,160 --> 00:50:24,960
that is really interesting because that

1423
00:50:23,520 --> 00:50:26,480
feels a lot more sustainable than like

1424
00:50:24,960 --> 00:50:28,720
here's your goal okay but also when your

1425
00:50:26,480 --> 00:50:30,240
goal is make sure uh the experience is

1426
00:50:28,720 --> 00:50:31,920
great and people support tickets are

1427
00:50:30,240 --> 00:50:34,960
down it's just like naturally they need

1428
00:50:31,920 --> 00:50:37,520
to want this to happen totally and

1429
00:50:34,960 --> 00:50:39,200
actually there was a I I I have a a a

1430
00:50:37,520 --> 00:50:40,640
sort of a a framework around like I

1431
00:50:39,200 --> 00:50:44,559
think there are five different types of

1432
00:50:40,640 --> 00:50:47,200
product managers that has kind of held

1433
00:50:44,559 --> 00:50:49,119
true. So, this is a a framework that

1434
00:50:47,200 --> 00:50:50,960
just came out of a random jam at Uber

1435
00:50:49,119 --> 00:50:53,040
when I was talking to some some of my my

1436
00:50:50,960 --> 00:50:55,040
colleagues there and we formulated this

1437
00:50:53,040 --> 00:50:56,559
in terms of helping uh with hiring

1438
00:50:55,040 --> 00:50:58,000
practices. Everywhere I've gone, I've

1439
00:50:56,559 --> 00:51:00,240
also been like best friends with the

1440
00:50:58,000 --> 00:51:01,440
recruiters because honestly my whole

1441
00:51:00,240 --> 00:51:03,680
thing is like got to build the right

1442
00:51:01,440 --> 00:51:05,760
team. So, we have to really partner very

1443
00:51:03,680 --> 00:51:08,480
deeply. And at Uber, we developed this

1444
00:51:05,760 --> 00:51:11,760
uh this this this five archetypes of a

1445
00:51:08,480 --> 00:51:15,680
PM. Um and I've to this day I still

1446
00:51:11,760 --> 00:51:17,680
think it's like actually exactly true

1447
00:51:15,680 --> 00:51:18,800
and it still holds true to this day. But

1448
00:51:17,680 --> 00:51:20,400
is that interesting? You want me to kind

1449
00:51:18,800 --> 00:51:22,240
of go into that? Absolutely. I'm so

1450
00:51:20,400 --> 00:51:24,079
excited to hear with you there. These

1451
00:51:22,240 --> 00:51:25,680
are the five that I found to be most

1452
00:51:24,079 --> 00:51:27,359
enduring and actually the most like kind

1453
00:51:25,680 --> 00:51:28,880
of different, right? And and when you

1454
00:51:27,359 --> 00:51:30,559
talk about I love the way you put this,

1455
00:51:28,880 --> 00:51:32,559
Lenny, which is when you hire the right

1456
00:51:30,559 --> 00:51:34,880
people and like how they're naturally

1457
00:51:32,559 --> 00:51:37,119
motivated by different things, right?

1458
00:51:34,880 --> 00:51:40,319
And so these are the five that that we

1459
00:51:37,119 --> 00:51:43,440
came up with. Number one is the consumer

1460
00:51:40,319 --> 00:51:47,520
PM. So this is the person that's like

1461
00:51:43,440 --> 00:51:50,480
half designer, half product person,

1462
00:51:47,520 --> 00:51:53,119
really obsessed over the details. Is it

1463
00:51:50,480 --> 00:51:54,880
delightful? Is it crafted enough? Oh my

1464
00:51:53,119 --> 00:51:56,720
goodness, this is three pixels off. I

1465
00:51:54,880 --> 00:51:59,280
can't stand it. this is like making

1466
00:51:56,720 --> 00:52:01,520
driving me nuts like why is this so

1467
00:51:59,280 --> 00:52:03,200
complex I mean these are the people that

1468
00:52:01,520 --> 00:52:04,880
you think of as like you know you know

1469
00:52:03,200 --> 00:52:07,119
sometimes the quintessential PM is the

1470
00:52:04,880 --> 00:52:09,839
consumer PM but that's just one type

1471
00:52:07,119 --> 00:52:11,280
right and um another type just kind of

1472
00:52:09,839 --> 00:52:13,680
on the side we've talked about before is

1473
00:52:11,280 --> 00:52:16,960
the growth PM these people are like half

1474
00:52:13,680 --> 00:52:20,079
data scientist half product person they

1475
00:52:16,960 --> 00:52:23,040
are kind of wired to think numbers first

1476
00:52:20,079 --> 00:52:24,559
and they have this kind of air about

1477
00:52:23,040 --> 00:52:26,079
them that's like the best ones do which

1478
00:52:24,559 --> 00:52:28,559
is like I'm really skep skeptical. Show

1479
00:52:26,079 --> 00:52:30,880
me the data. Let's run a test and prove

1480
00:52:28,559 --> 00:52:32,559
it. I don't believe you. Right? And it's

1481
00:52:30,880 --> 00:52:33,680
and and I start with these two in the

1482
00:52:32,559 --> 00:52:36,400
framework because they're actually

1483
00:52:33,680 --> 00:52:38,400
really different. Right? One, it's like

1484
00:52:36,400 --> 00:52:40,480
I have vibe. I feel the vibe. This is

1485
00:52:38,400 --> 00:52:42,240
better. And the other one's like, no, I

1486
00:52:40,480 --> 00:52:44,000
don't believe you. We should test this

1487
00:52:42,240 --> 00:52:45,920
and prove it. And that's like a really

1488
00:52:44,000 --> 00:52:47,200
healthy tension. I love, you know,

1489
00:52:45,920 --> 00:52:48,800
having two people in a room like

1490
00:52:47,200 --> 00:52:50,240
debating that. Like great, we are going

1491
00:52:48,800 --> 00:52:51,280
to get some good things done and we're

1492
00:52:50,240 --> 00:52:54,559
going to we're going to move the product

1493
00:52:51,280 --> 00:52:56,559
forward. The third type is um you know

1494
00:52:54,559 --> 00:52:58,240
kind of what I call the GMP PM or the

1495
00:52:56,559 --> 00:53:01,359
business PM, right? These are like kind

1496
00:52:58,240 --> 00:53:02,720
of half MBA, half product person. These

1497
00:53:01,359 --> 00:53:05,599
are folks that are kind of naturally

1498
00:53:02,720 --> 00:53:07,599
wired to start with the business model

1499
00:53:05,599 --> 00:53:09,280
and think about what are the margins,

1500
00:53:07,599 --> 00:53:11,359
like what are the opportunities, where's

1501
00:53:09,280 --> 00:53:13,760
the value being created? And we had a

1502
00:53:11,359 --> 00:53:15,200
lot of these at at at um at Uber and

1503
00:53:13,760 --> 00:53:16,559
they were the marketplace PMs and

1504
00:53:15,200 --> 00:53:18,079
they're just like I loved working with

1505
00:53:16,559 --> 00:53:19,920
them because their their minds just work

1506
00:53:18,079 --> 00:53:21,440
differently. they just thought about

1507
00:53:19,920 --> 00:53:24,240
problems from like well what is the

1508
00:53:21,440 --> 00:53:26,800
incentive here right and you this is a

1509
00:53:24,240 --> 00:53:29,040
fascinating type of mind to to work with

1510
00:53:26,800 --> 00:53:30,559
um another one I I found this is it's

1511
00:53:29,040 --> 00:53:32,480
it's actually more nuanced than you

1512
00:53:30,559 --> 00:53:36,240
think is like there's a certain sort of

1513
00:53:32,480 --> 00:53:38,559
archetype that I I call the platform PM

1514
00:53:36,240 --> 00:53:40,720
which is someone who's like really

1515
00:53:38,559 --> 00:53:43,359
deeply wired to kind of build tools for

1516
00:53:40,720 --> 00:53:45,680
other people and at Uber we had like

1517
00:53:43,359 --> 00:53:48,240
internal platforms for like messaging or

1518
00:53:45,680 --> 00:53:49,359
for you know building internal tools and

1519
00:53:48,240 --> 00:53:50,880
often times s these folks are

1520
00:53:49,359 --> 00:53:52,720
overlooked, but it's like actually a

1521
00:53:50,880 --> 00:53:54,240
really deep wiring because these are the

1522
00:53:52,720 --> 00:53:55,440
people that are going to build the

1523
00:53:54,240 --> 00:53:57,040
systems that are going to make you go

1524
00:53:55,440 --> 00:54:00,400
faster, right? And that's what they love

1525
00:53:57,040 --> 00:54:02,400
doing. Um, and the last one I would say

1526
00:54:00,400 --> 00:54:05,760
I used to call an algorithms PM, but now

1527
00:54:02,400 --> 00:54:08,319
in the in the uh in the uh the the the

1528
00:54:05,760 --> 00:54:10,880
world of of AI, I'm going to rename this

1529
00:54:08,319 --> 00:54:12,800
to research PM. And these are like half

1530
00:54:10,880 --> 00:54:15,520
researcher, half engineer, half product

1531
00:54:12,800 --> 00:54:17,280
person. And these these minds are

1532
00:54:15,520 --> 00:54:18,880
amazing. So like basically they think

1533
00:54:17,280 --> 00:54:21,280
you know you know traditional Google

1534
00:54:18,880 --> 00:54:23,359
search algorithm PM right but nowadays

1535
00:54:21,280 --> 00:54:25,920
it's like who are the people who really

1536
00:54:23,359 --> 00:54:28,240
have that product taste but deeply

1537
00:54:25,920 --> 00:54:30,240
understand the tech and the you know the

1538
00:54:28,240 --> 00:54:32,400
way the models are trained to go and

1539
00:54:30,240 --> 00:54:34,559
affect that and build the most amazing

1540
00:54:32,400 --> 00:54:37,200
product. So those are the five I still

1541
00:54:34,559 --> 00:54:38,720
think I to this day these hold true and

1542
00:54:37,200 --> 00:54:40,800
we might have been on to something the

1543
00:54:38,720 --> 00:54:42,319
day that we brainstormed this at Uber

1544
00:54:40,800 --> 00:54:43,680
but uh yeah I'm curious to hear your

1545
00:54:42,319 --> 00:54:44,880
feedback. This is great. As you're

1546
00:54:43,680 --> 00:54:46,240
talking, I'm just like, here's that

1547
00:54:44,880 --> 00:54:49,839
person. Here's that person. Okay, they

1548
00:54:46,240 --> 00:54:51,599
fit here. Uh, this super resonates. This

1549
00:54:49,839 --> 00:54:53,440
episode is brought to you by Content

contentsquare.com/lenny.

1572
00:55:40,079 --> 00:55:44,880
So just to summarize, there's consumer

1573
00:55:41,680 --> 00:55:47,839
PMs, growth PMs, business/GMPs,

1574
00:55:44,880 --> 00:55:49,599
platform PMs, and sort of research PMs.

1575
00:55:47,839 --> 00:55:50,960
Uh a lot of people call them AIP PMs

1576
00:55:49,599 --> 00:55:52,319
now. I feel like that's the term that's

1577
00:55:50,960 --> 00:55:54,160
really popular. You have to evolve with

1578
00:55:52,319 --> 00:55:56,240
the times. Yeah. But also the other part

1579
00:55:54,160 --> 00:55:57,520
of the framework I find uh kind of

1580
00:55:56,240 --> 00:55:59,599
interesting is that everyone's like a

1581
00:55:57,520 --> 00:56:01,359
primary has a primary one and a

1582
00:55:59,599 --> 00:56:03,760
secondary one. It's kind of like one of

1583
00:56:01,359 --> 00:56:05,760
those like personality tests, right? And

1584
00:56:03,760 --> 00:56:07,359
maybe we kind of did this just because

1585
00:56:05,760 --> 00:56:08,720
it was hard to pigeon hole people and I

1586
00:56:07,359 --> 00:56:10,880
I myself don't think I was

1587
00:56:08,720 --> 00:56:12,799
pigeonholeable, but I I do think that

1588
00:56:10,880 --> 00:56:15,119
people like, you know, kind of lead with

1589
00:56:12,799 --> 00:56:16,720
one type of thinking and then also have

1590
00:56:15,119 --> 00:56:19,280
the secondary thing that keeps them in

1591
00:56:16,720 --> 00:56:20,880
balance. And so if you believe that and

1592
00:56:19,280 --> 00:56:23,119
you apply it to your team, I'm curious

1593
00:56:20,880 --> 00:56:25,440
to hear, you know, from your listeners

1594
00:56:23,119 --> 00:56:27,599
like sort of if this does resonate or

1595
00:56:25,440 --> 00:56:28,960
not. And you know, maybe this framework

1596
00:56:27,599 --> 00:56:30,720
will help you realize that you're

1597
00:56:28,960 --> 00:56:32,640
missing someone that that you should be

1598
00:56:30,720 --> 00:56:34,880
not missing. What was your archetype

1599
00:56:32,640 --> 00:56:35,920
when you were a PM? This is and and

1600
00:56:34,880 --> 00:56:37,200
that's the other thing with personality

1601
00:56:35,920 --> 00:56:39,119
types is the ones you hear, you're like,

1602
00:56:37,200 --> 00:56:41,119
"This is me. This is I I own this,

1603
00:56:39,119 --> 00:56:44,799
right? There's no doubt about it. I am a

1604
00:56:41,119 --> 00:56:47,040
consumer PM uh and also a growth PM.

1605
00:56:44,799 --> 00:56:49,040
That's that's my primarily consumer. I

1606
00:56:47,040 --> 00:56:50,160
just I I can't I mean this is what I

1607
00:56:49,040 --> 00:56:52,400
told you about you know the other

1608
00:56:50,160 --> 00:56:55,359
products I've loved. I've see the I can

1609
00:56:52,400 --> 00:56:57,359
see the details that people put into it

1610
00:56:55,359 --> 00:56:58,799
and I so appreciate that but at the end

1611
00:56:57,359 --> 00:57:01,520
of the day it's like you got to measure

1612
00:56:58,799 --> 00:57:03,680
things right so that's what I am but you

1613
00:57:01,520 --> 00:57:04,720
know again everyone's different. I love

1614
00:57:03,680 --> 00:57:06,240
your point about how a lot of people

1615
00:57:04,720 --> 00:57:07,839
think of PM like they hear that first

1616
00:57:06,240 --> 00:57:09,359
example like oh I guess that's what I

1617
00:57:07,839 --> 00:57:11,200
need to be because that's what everyone

1618
00:57:09,359 --> 00:57:12,640
talks about when they're amazing product

1619
00:57:11,200 --> 00:57:14,720
managers but you're saying there's many

1620
00:57:12,640 --> 00:57:16,799
other ways to be a successful PM. We did

1621
00:57:14,720 --> 00:57:18,160
a personality test uh at Airbnb when I

1622
00:57:16,799 --> 00:57:20,880
was there and one of the biggest

1623
00:57:18,160 --> 00:57:22,720
takeaways was it's like this color test

1624
00:57:20,880 --> 00:57:24,799
and you get a color green or yellow or

1625
00:57:22,720 --> 00:57:26,880
red and like the team was all over the

1626
00:57:24,799 --> 00:57:28,799
spectrum and so it was a really good

1627
00:57:26,880 --> 00:57:30,640
reminder just you can be a different

1628
00:57:28,799 --> 00:57:32,720
type of person and still be really

1629
00:57:30,640 --> 00:57:33,839
successful in this role of PM and it's

1630
00:57:32,720 --> 00:57:35,680
probably because of these different

1631
00:57:33,839 --> 00:57:37,280
archetypes and different needs and roles

1632
00:57:35,680 --> 00:57:39,520
of PMs like there's this word product

1633
00:57:37,280 --> 00:57:41,599
manager but there's many things that PMs

1634
00:57:39,520 --> 00:57:45,119
do and also as an investor now it's

1635
00:57:41,599 --> 00:57:48,640
really important to see the fit of the

1636
00:57:45,119 --> 00:57:51,760
founder to the market because if you put

1637
00:57:48,640 --> 00:57:54,799
a consumer PM into like a really, you

1638
00:57:51,760 --> 00:57:56,400
know, boring regulated industry, they're

1639
00:57:54,799 --> 00:57:57,599
probably going to get frustrated and

1640
00:57:56,400 --> 00:57:58,559
they're probably not going to see it

1641
00:57:57,599 --> 00:58:00,160
through. Whereas like there's people

1642
00:57:58,559 --> 00:58:01,680
that you look at, you know, the pitch

1643
00:58:00,160 --> 00:58:04,799
and you're like, "Wow, this is you are

1644
00:58:01,680 --> 00:58:06,640
really passionate about this problem and

1645
00:58:04,799 --> 00:58:08,480
you really care about building tools for

1646
00:58:06,640 --> 00:58:10,480
others and this is exactly this is the

1647
00:58:08,480 --> 00:58:12,079
Twilio PM or you know, whatever it might

1648
00:58:10,480 --> 00:58:14,000
be. you're a perfect fit for this

1649
00:58:12,079 --> 00:58:16,240
business and like that's awesome, right?

1650
00:58:14,000 --> 00:58:17,680
So, I think that yeah, I I love that

1651
00:58:16,240 --> 00:58:19,599
what you just said in in the summary

1652
00:58:17,680 --> 00:58:21,280
because I think there's no one way to be

1653
00:58:19,599 --> 00:58:22,720
a PM and I think this is sort of the

1654
00:58:21,280 --> 00:58:24,960
hopefully this framework will get give

1655
00:58:22,720 --> 00:58:26,799
people a little bit more space to be,

1656
00:58:24,960 --> 00:58:28,240
you know, express who they really are.

1657
00:58:26,799 --> 00:58:29,680
I'm curious if other functions also have

1658
00:58:28,240 --> 00:58:31,040
these sort of archetypes like designers

1659
00:58:29,680 --> 00:58:32,480
and engineers, but we don't need to get

1660
00:58:31,040 --> 00:58:34,559
into that. How about if you're listening

1661
00:58:32,480 --> 00:58:36,160
to this on YouTube, leave a comment of

1662
00:58:34,559 --> 00:58:37,440
which of these archetypes you think you

1663
00:58:36,160 --> 00:58:39,280
might be. What's your primary and

1664
00:58:37,440 --> 00:58:42,960
secondary? I'll read them again.

1665
00:58:39,280 --> 00:58:45,760
Consumer PM, growth PM, business GMP,

1666
00:58:42,960 --> 00:58:48,960
platform PM, research

1667
00:58:45,760 --> 00:58:50,400
PM. Love it. Okay. Uh, I want to talk

1668
00:58:48,960 --> 00:58:52,160
about hiring. So, this actually came up

1669
00:58:50,400 --> 00:58:53,839
a lot when I was chatting with folks

1670
00:58:52,160 --> 00:58:55,599
that you've worked with, especially uh

1671
00:58:53,839 --> 00:58:57,119
Nick Turley, who's head of product at

1672
00:58:55,599 --> 00:58:59,280
Chad GPT who were trying to get on the

1673
00:58:57,119 --> 00:59:01,760
podcast because that's an uh what he's

1674
00:58:59,280 --> 00:59:04,640
awesome. That's what I've heard. Uh so

1675
00:59:01,760 --> 00:59:07,359
he told me that the current head of

1676
00:59:04,640 --> 00:59:09,040
engineering, the lead product engineer,

1677
00:59:07,359 --> 00:59:12,240
the head of design and head of marketing

1678
00:59:09,040 --> 00:59:14,240
at chat GPT are people that you hired.

1679
00:59:12,240 --> 00:59:15,839
Uh also many of the people that you

1680
00:59:14,240 --> 00:59:17,200
hired have gone on to do incredible

1681
00:59:15,839 --> 00:59:18,559
things. You've shared a few of those

1682
00:59:17,200 --> 00:59:19,839
names. Many of them have been on the

1683
00:59:18,559 --> 00:59:21,680
podcast, which is the ultimate measure

1684
00:59:19,839 --> 00:59:23,280
of success.

1685
00:59:21,680 --> 00:59:25,280
So let me just ask you this. What's

1686
00:59:23,280 --> 00:59:27,920
what's one thing you look for in people

1687
00:59:25,280 --> 00:59:29,200
you hire that you think are that you

1688
00:59:27,920 --> 00:59:30,640
think people sleep on? that you think

1689
00:59:29,200 --> 00:59:33,440
people aren't paying enough attention to

1690
00:59:30,640 --> 00:59:34,799
that helps you find amazing stars.

1691
00:59:33,440 --> 00:59:36,559
That's really flattering to hear that

1692
00:59:34,799 --> 00:59:38,319
from Nick. Um Nick is one of the best

1693
00:59:36,559 --> 00:59:40,559
people I've worked with period. In fact,

1694
00:59:38,319 --> 00:59:43,359
I want to just do a quick shout out like

1695
00:59:40,559 --> 00:59:44,799
folks at OpenAI I are are pretty much

1696
00:59:43,359 --> 00:59:46,319
the best people I've ever worked with in

1697
00:59:44,799 --> 00:59:48,000
my career. When I took the job, I told

1698
00:59:46,319 --> 00:59:49,680
the team this is going to be my last

1699
00:59:48,000 --> 00:59:51,920
operating role and I'm going to leave it

1700
00:59:49,680 --> 00:59:54,400
all on the field and I'm just going to

1701
00:59:51,920 --> 00:59:56,559
go all out. And basically I spent

1702
00:59:54,400 --> 00:59:59,280
probably as much time if not more time

1703
00:59:56,559 --> 01:00:01,280
on recruiting and building the team um

1704
00:59:59,280 --> 01:00:03,200
than I as I did sort of thinking about

1705
01:00:01,280 --> 01:00:05,040
the product. And this is going back to

1706
01:00:03,200 --> 01:00:06,640
sort of what I said earlier about I

1707
01:00:05,040 --> 01:00:09,440
think you got to bring the right people

1708
01:00:06,640 --> 01:00:11,440
together to have a huge impact. And

1709
01:00:09,440 --> 01:00:13,200
often times leaders overlook this and

1710
01:00:11,440 --> 01:00:16,559
they're like ah just a warm body. But

1711
01:00:13,200 --> 01:00:19,280
truly you know people who have strengths

1712
01:00:16,559 --> 01:00:21,359
in certain areas complement others with

1713
01:00:19,280 --> 01:00:23,760
strengths in other areas. And when you

1714
01:00:21,359 --> 01:00:25,280
build that team, amazing things happen.

1715
01:00:23,760 --> 01:00:27,040
It's the mo, it's the best investment

1716
01:00:25,280 --> 01:00:28,799
you can make. It's going to pay off so

1717
01:00:27,040 --> 01:00:31,119
many dividends. So, I think that's my

1718
01:00:28,799 --> 01:00:32,799
opening salvo in terms of like, you

1719
01:00:31,119 --> 01:00:33,920
know, you got to get the everyone who's

1720
01:00:32,799 --> 01:00:35,440
listening out there, you got to make

1721
01:00:33,920 --> 01:00:37,680
sure you look at everyone in your team,

1722
01:00:35,440 --> 01:00:40,640
you look at what you need and you have

1723
01:00:37,680 --> 01:00:43,520
to get the best in each. And uh truly

1724
01:00:40,640 --> 01:00:46,559
like you know in in in in my farewell

1725
01:00:43,520 --> 01:00:48,559
dinner at OpenAI I think I I I close

1726
01:00:46,559 --> 01:00:49,680
with just that that like look I don't

1727
01:00:48,559 --> 01:00:50,960
even know what I would do after this

1728
01:00:49,680 --> 01:00:53,040
because all the best people I've worked

1729
01:00:50,960 --> 01:00:55,440
with are here. We have Ian Silber

1730
01:00:53,040 --> 01:00:58,480
running design there. Thomas Dimpson you

1731
01:00:55,440 --> 01:01:00,720
know Joey Flynn Ryan Oor Nick Turley was

1732
01:00:58,480 --> 01:01:01,839
amazing person I met there. Joanne, I

1733
01:01:00,720 --> 01:01:03,359
mean just I have so many people I'm

1734
01:01:01,839 --> 01:01:05,520
missing but you know Coley on product

1735
01:01:03,359 --> 01:01:08,720
marketing Eric Antinau on the marketing

1736
01:01:05,520 --> 01:01:10,720
comm side on engineer you you you the

1737
01:01:08,720 --> 01:01:13,280
name the list goes on product operations

1738
01:01:10,720 --> 01:01:14,880
is is is stellar. I'm so proud of like

1739
01:01:13,280 --> 01:01:16,640
honestly the pr the team that I built

1740
01:01:14,880 --> 01:01:19,040
there more than than the products. Um so

1741
01:01:16,640 --> 01:01:20,880
I just wanted to say that like it's it's

1742
01:01:19,040 --> 01:01:22,160
a it's a big thing that I really care

1743
01:01:20,880 --> 01:01:24,079
about and I hope more leaders think

1744
01:01:22,160 --> 01:01:25,680
about that too is like really be mindful

1745
01:01:24,079 --> 01:01:27,520
of putting your team together and and

1746
01:01:25,680 --> 01:01:29,119
think about that as a product and you

1747
01:01:27,520 --> 01:01:31,280
have to really craft that. You have to

1748
01:01:29,119 --> 01:01:32,559
really care about the team, right? Just

1749
01:01:31,280 --> 01:01:34,720
to double down on that point actually

1750
01:01:32,559 --> 01:01:37,520
before you get to the next tip here is I

1751
01:01:34,720 --> 01:01:38,880
just love this answer which is in you

1752
01:01:37,520 --> 01:01:40,640
know if I were to ask someone here's

1753
01:01:38,880 --> 01:01:43,119
hire what's your hiring advice what do

1754
01:01:40,640 --> 01:01:45,359
you look for that people may not be

1755
01:01:43,119 --> 01:01:46,799
looking for enough. Uh I love that most

1756
01:01:45,359 --> 01:01:48,240
of it would be like in that person

1757
01:01:46,799 --> 01:01:51,040
here's what you need to focus on and

1758
01:01:48,240 --> 01:01:53,359
here's the interview question and but uh

1759
01:01:51,040 --> 01:01:55,440
the kind of your broad answer so far is

1760
01:01:53,359 --> 01:01:57,119
it's not actually about the person so

1761
01:01:55,440 --> 01:01:59,680
much as what is the team going to look

1762
01:01:57,119 --> 01:02:01,440
like and where do we need spikes where

1763
01:01:59,680 --> 01:02:02,960
do we need to balance out the

1764
01:02:01,440 --> 01:02:04,960
composition of this Avengers that we're

1765
01:02:02,960 --> 01:02:07,440
building. Totally. Totally. That's

1766
01:02:04,960 --> 01:02:09,680
exactly right. And so so that being

1767
01:02:07,440 --> 01:02:11,839
said, I I guess I have uh I guess on

1768
01:02:09,680 --> 01:02:14,319
brand I have two things I want to share

1769
01:02:11,839 --> 01:02:17,520
about about sort of hiring the right

1770
01:02:14,319 --> 01:02:19,119
team. Um I have this saying um I

1771
01:02:17,520 --> 01:02:20,480
actually have this like doc that I've

1772
01:02:19,119 --> 01:02:22,400
taken around various companies called

1773
01:02:20,480 --> 01:02:24,559
the PXD API which is like here's how to

1774
01:02:22,400 --> 01:02:26,480
work with me. And in it there's there's

1775
01:02:24,559 --> 01:02:28,240
um there's a saying that I have which is

1776
01:02:26,480 --> 01:02:30,240
what I really optimize for for everyone

1777
01:02:28,240 --> 01:02:33,280
that I support and everyone I hire which

1778
01:02:30,240 --> 01:02:36,559
is in six months

1779
01:02:33,280 --> 01:02:39,119
if I'm telling you what to do I've hired

1780
01:02:36,559 --> 01:02:42,160
the wrong person.

1781
01:02:39,119 --> 01:02:45,280
And it's just kind of served me really

1782
01:02:42,160 --> 01:02:47,760
well as on three different levels,

1783
01:02:45,280 --> 01:02:49,680
right? Number one, it's a reminder for

1784
01:02:47,760 --> 01:02:52,240
myself when I'm either hiring or looking

1785
01:02:49,680 --> 01:02:56,319
for the person is to keep my bar super

1786
01:02:52,240 --> 01:02:58,799
high and just not settle because if I do

1787
01:02:56,319 --> 01:03:01,040
most likely in 6 months, it would not be

1788
01:02:58,799 --> 01:03:02,720
true that I that I would be able to let

1789
01:03:01,040 --> 01:03:04,160
this person run and I would still be

1790
01:03:02,720 --> 01:03:07,599
telling them what to do, which is not

1791
01:03:04,160 --> 01:03:09,839
what I want. That is not my desire.

1792
01:03:07,599 --> 01:03:12,640
The second sort of effect of that is

1793
01:03:09,839 --> 01:03:14,480
that it's I say that to people, you

1794
01:03:12,640 --> 01:03:17,039
know, when they come on the team or as

1795
01:03:14,480 --> 01:03:18,559
we're making the fire hire because, you

1796
01:03:17,039 --> 01:03:22,480
know, it communicates to them that

1797
01:03:18,559 --> 01:03:24,240
that's my bar and that's how they know

1798
01:03:22,480 --> 01:03:25,520
they'll be successful, right? And

1799
01:03:24,240 --> 01:03:27,440
something to kind of work towards,

1800
01:03:25,520 --> 01:03:29,680
right? And the third thing is kind of a

1801
01:03:27,440 --> 01:03:32,960
joint thing for the both of us which is

1802
01:03:29,680 --> 01:03:35,760
it kind of gives us it it helps me and

1803
01:03:32,960 --> 01:03:39,119
the person operate on a different level

1804
01:03:35,760 --> 01:03:41,839
where it's not the goal is not like did

1805
01:03:39,119 --> 01:03:44,480
you hit this OKR did you hit this goal

1806
01:03:41,839 --> 01:03:46,160
the the meta goal becomes hey are we

1807
01:03:44,480 --> 01:03:48,160
building you know are we calibrating

1808
01:03:46,160 --> 01:03:50,880
enough are we actually getting to a spot

1809
01:03:48,160 --> 01:03:53,520
where in six months like you're the one

1810
01:03:50,880 --> 01:03:54,960
telling me what needs to be done like

1811
01:03:53,520 --> 01:03:56,960
like that are we are we getting there

1812
01:03:54,960 --> 01:03:59,920
right Because then if if that's the

1813
01:03:56,960 --> 01:04:01,520
framing every you know mistake that you

1814
01:03:59,920 --> 01:04:03,440
know is made or whatever on either of

1815
01:04:01,520 --> 01:04:05,440
our our parts is becomes a learning

1816
01:04:03,440 --> 01:04:07,839
opportunity in terms of like well how do

1817
01:04:05,440 --> 01:04:11,119
we grow to to from this to where we want

1818
01:04:07,839 --> 01:04:13,119
to be in six months right and how is it

1819
01:04:11,119 --> 01:04:15,680
possible that you know I as a as a

1820
01:04:13,119 --> 01:04:17,119
manager can do the right things to set

1821
01:04:15,680 --> 01:04:19,599
this person up for success so that I

1822
01:04:17,119 --> 01:04:21,599
don't have to be involved in six months

1823
01:04:19,599 --> 01:04:23,280
right and I think that those those three

1824
01:04:21,599 --> 01:04:25,440
things like and and and being able to

1825
01:04:23,280 --> 01:04:27,920
have that second order effect of this

1826
01:04:25,440 --> 01:04:29,760
simple razor in 6 months I'm telling

1827
01:04:27,920 --> 01:04:32,160
what to do I've hired the wrong person

1828
01:04:29,760 --> 01:04:34,640
it puts pressure on me it puts pressure

1829
01:04:32,160 --> 01:04:36,640
on the person and it creates this really

1830
01:04:34,640 --> 01:04:39,520
interesting environment and and this

1831
01:04:36,640 --> 01:04:44,720
kind of safe space to really think about

1832
01:04:39,520 --> 01:04:46,880
are we heading towards that goal and

1833
01:04:44,720 --> 01:04:48,640
again every place I've been at as much

1834
01:04:46,880 --> 01:04:50,559
as I've loved building the product I've

1835
01:04:48,640 --> 01:04:52,160
taken so much pride in building the team

1836
01:04:50,559 --> 01:04:54,880
and it's just been so much of a pleasure

1837
01:04:52,160 --> 01:04:56,880
and I think this is my one of the two

1838
01:04:54,880 --> 01:04:58,880
secrets that I have here. This is so

1839
01:04:56,880 --> 01:05:00,640
good. I want to I have a follow-up

1840
01:04:58,880 --> 01:05:03,359
question, but just to point out why I

1841
01:05:00,640 --> 01:05:07,200
think this is so genius. Is it there's

1842
01:05:03,359 --> 01:05:10,319
kind of a assumption here of this person

1843
01:05:07,200 --> 01:05:12,480
uh you can trust them? So there's like a

1844
01:05:10,319 --> 01:05:14,799
do I trust this person? Do I feel like

1845
01:05:12,480 --> 01:05:16,559
they're going to be proactive? Do I feel

1846
01:05:14,799 --> 01:05:19,119
like they're going to have uh correct

1847
01:05:16,559 --> 01:05:21,359
insights? Essentially, taste and gut

1848
01:05:19,119 --> 01:05:22,960
feeling. Uh it's like the layer below

1849
01:05:21,359 --> 01:05:24,640
this question, which is great. And also

1850
01:05:22,960 --> 01:05:27,920
just this like autonomy. It feels like

1851
01:05:24,640 --> 01:05:30,400
you autonomy almost implies so many

1852
01:05:27,920 --> 01:05:33,039
important traits of somebody that you

1853
01:05:30,400 --> 01:05:36,079
want to hire. And I love just how simple

1854
01:05:33,039 --> 01:05:37,359
this question is for both you and them.

1855
01:05:36,079 --> 01:05:38,480
Thank you. And and really without

1856
01:05:37,359 --> 01:05:41,680
autonomy, I love what you said about

1857
01:05:38,480 --> 01:05:43,760
autonomy because truly if without

1858
01:05:41,680 --> 01:05:46,640
as as a leader, as a manager, your goal

1859
01:05:43,760 --> 01:05:48,880
is to scale.

1860
01:05:46,640 --> 01:05:51,760
And if you don't have if this thing this

1861
01:05:48,880 --> 01:05:53,760
simple statement is not true, how are

1862
01:05:51,760 --> 01:05:55,920
you able to build the best company, the

1863
01:05:53,760 --> 01:05:57,760
best product? So here's the followup

1864
01:05:55,920 --> 01:06:00,079
question. Is this mostly for leaders

1865
01:05:57,760 --> 01:06:01,920
like say head of product at GPT? Say

1866
01:06:00,079 --> 01:06:04,640
someone's not a CPO, they're just like I

1867
01:06:01,920 --> 01:06:05,920
don't know a manager of a PM team. Do

1868
01:06:04,640 --> 01:06:07,119
you find is there a version of this that

1869
01:06:05,920 --> 01:06:09,440
you think might be useful to them or is

1870
01:06:07,119 --> 01:06:11,280
this mostly for leaders? I think this is

1871
01:06:09,440 --> 01:06:12,960
for everyone.

1872
01:06:11,280 --> 01:06:16,480
I think it's for everyone who is a

1873
01:06:12,960 --> 01:06:18,559
manager, right? Because you know if

1874
01:06:16,480 --> 01:06:21,520
you're going to be a successful manager

1875
01:06:18,559 --> 01:06:23,119
at any company um or a leader at any

1876
01:06:21,520 --> 01:06:24,960
company and if you're if you're kind of

1877
01:06:23,119 --> 01:06:27,760
starting as a line manager or whatnot

1878
01:06:24,960 --> 01:06:30,160
and you're kind of you know

1879
01:06:27,760 --> 01:06:32,240
wanting to grow or even just wanting to

1880
01:06:30,160 --> 01:06:33,920
you know if you're early at a company

1881
01:06:32,240 --> 01:06:37,200
you have so much institutional knowledge

1882
01:06:33,920 --> 01:06:39,119
and so getting more uh sort of leverage

1883
01:06:37,200 --> 01:06:42,559
in terms of being able to pass on the

1884
01:06:39,119 --> 01:06:44,720
wisdom that you've learned is so crucial

1885
01:06:42,559 --> 01:06:46,559
uh into being successful. that I think

1886
01:06:44,720 --> 01:06:48,799
every manager should should approach

1887
01:06:46,559 --> 01:06:52,319
their, you know, their their reports

1888
01:06:48,799 --> 01:06:53,920
with this because truly like that's it's

1889
01:06:52,319 --> 01:06:55,599
just good for everyone. It's good for

1890
01:06:53,920 --> 01:06:58,400
the company to have more kind of

1891
01:06:55,599 --> 01:07:00,799
leverage and and scale. It's good for uh

1892
01:06:58,400 --> 01:07:02,160
the the person who's being brought onto

1893
01:07:00,799 --> 01:07:04,400
the team because they know what success

1894
01:07:02,160 --> 01:07:07,200
looks like and it gives them a path to

1895
01:07:04,400 --> 01:07:10,880
kind of keep on growing. And it's great

1896
01:07:07,200 --> 01:07:14,799
for you as a leader, as a manager to be

1897
01:07:10,880 --> 01:07:17,920
able to basically scale up the entire uh

1898
01:07:14,799 --> 01:07:20,960
uh sort of expertise of your team. And I

1899
01:07:17,920 --> 01:07:22,720
imagine you don't even need to plan to

1900
01:07:20,960 --> 01:07:25,520
not tell them what to do. Like it's just

1901
01:07:22,720 --> 01:07:27,839
a good lens into are they going to be

1902
01:07:25,520 --> 01:07:29,920
amazing even if you plan to be telling

1903
01:07:27,839 --> 01:07:31,440
them sort of what to do. Yeah. Exactly.

1904
01:07:29,920 --> 01:07:33,440
And the other thing is like again in

1905
01:07:31,440 --> 01:07:35,599
your interview process, you kind of end

1906
01:07:33,440 --> 01:07:37,440
up looking for these insights, right?

1907
01:07:35,599 --> 01:07:40,240
and you look for like the behaviors of

1908
01:07:37,440 --> 01:07:42,480
like, oh, are they actually going to be

1909
01:07:40,240 --> 01:07:44,160
potentially able to to achieve this in

1910
01:07:42,480 --> 01:07:45,760
six months and that's going to give you

1911
01:07:44,160 --> 01:07:47,760
a really good lens on the picking side,

1912
01:07:45,760 --> 01:07:49,280
not just the development side as well.

1913
01:07:47,760 --> 01:07:51,760
Peter, what's your second secret? This

1914
01:07:49,280 --> 01:07:53,599
is uh one for one. Yeah. Okay. The

1915
01:07:51,760 --> 01:07:55,839
second one I'd say is I I feel really

1916
01:07:53,599 --> 01:07:58,640
strongly about this, which is um you

1917
01:07:55,839 --> 01:08:02,000
know, the area that I look for most is

1918
01:07:58,640 --> 01:08:04,960
growth mindset. Um, and I actually came

1919
01:08:02,000 --> 01:08:08,240
to this um, you know, some point in my

1920
01:08:04,960 --> 01:08:09,520
managing career at Facebook where I real

1921
01:08:08,240 --> 01:08:10,880
you know I did make a mistake and hired

1922
01:08:09,520 --> 01:08:12,880
someone who just didn't quite have that

1923
01:08:10,880 --> 01:08:17,199
growth mindset and it was really

1924
01:08:12,880 --> 01:08:18,640
difficult because you know

1925
01:08:17,199 --> 01:08:20,640
the way I say is like I don't have time

1926
01:08:18,640 --> 01:08:22,239
to sugar coat any feedback, right? And

1927
01:08:20,640 --> 01:08:24,080
frankly like the best people I've worked

1928
01:08:22,239 --> 01:08:25,440
with are the people who come into one

1929
01:08:24,080 --> 01:08:27,359
ones with me and yell at me and telling

1930
01:08:25,440 --> 01:08:29,679
them I'm I'm messing up. Like that's I

1931
01:08:27,359 --> 01:08:31,120
love that cuz that's there's no nothing

1932
01:08:29,679 --> 01:08:33,359
left unsaid and we're able to kind of

1933
01:08:31,120 --> 01:08:35,440
move the ball forward of like hey like

1934
01:08:33,359 --> 01:08:37,040
how do we get better from this and I

1935
01:08:35,440 --> 01:08:39,839
feel like growth mindset's one of those

1936
01:08:37,040 --> 01:08:42,319
things Lenny that feels really hard to

1937
01:08:39,839 --> 01:08:44,719
teach at a certain age and this is

1938
01:08:42,319 --> 01:08:47,040
really important to me and my family I

1939
01:08:44,719 --> 01:08:49,759
expect growth mindset of myself of my

1940
01:08:47,040 --> 01:08:51,440
kids you know my my colleagues at work

1941
01:08:49,759 --> 01:08:54,640
because I think it just like creates

1942
01:08:51,440 --> 01:08:56,319
this environment where everyone is open

1943
01:08:54,640 --> 01:08:58,159
to like what's the one thing I can can

1944
01:08:56,319 --> 01:09:01,759
get better at. And you know that whole

1945
01:08:58,159 --> 01:09:03,279
get 1% better every day can become true.

1946
01:09:01,759 --> 01:09:05,759
And it's it's funny because like I

1947
01:09:03,279 --> 01:09:07,520
whenever I go to teams like TGBT or Uber

1948
01:09:05,759 --> 01:09:10,080
when I'm al always the final interview

1949
01:09:07,520 --> 01:09:12,080
for someone in my org and I partner with

1950
01:09:10,080 --> 01:09:14,319
recruiting on developing that uh the

1951
01:09:12,080 --> 01:09:16,239
rubric, I always insist on doing the

1952
01:09:14,319 --> 01:09:18,640
last interview and I do not product

1953
01:09:16,239 --> 01:09:20,880
sense. I don't do design. I don't do

1954
01:09:18,640 --> 01:09:22,960
execution. I don't do metrics. I only do

1955
01:09:20,880 --> 01:09:25,359
growth mindset. And it's kind of like

1956
01:09:22,960 --> 01:09:27,279
well that's crazy. like what about all

1957
01:09:25,359 --> 01:09:29,520
of these other attributes? I'm like,

1958
01:09:27,279 --> 01:09:30,960
well, I'm pretty sure I can trust the

1959
01:09:29,520 --> 01:09:32,560
other people to assess the other

1960
01:09:30,960 --> 01:09:34,719
attributes. But I think the growth

1961
01:09:32,560 --> 01:09:37,520
mindset thing is so important to me that

1962
01:09:34,719 --> 01:09:40,319
that we build an org where people are

1963
01:09:37,520 --> 01:09:42,239
self-reflective and want to get better

1964
01:09:40,319 --> 01:09:44,880
and take that feedback and give that

1965
01:09:42,239 --> 01:09:47,359
feedback and it just is this meta unlock

1966
01:09:44,880 --> 01:09:49,520
that I found to be true. And really if

1967
01:09:47,359 --> 01:09:50,960
you don't have growth mindset then and

1968
01:09:49,520 --> 01:09:53,120
you're not open to feedback, you're not

1969
01:09:50,960 --> 01:09:55,440
open to learning, then that's like the

1970
01:09:53,120 --> 01:09:57,199
the the meta blocker, right? At that

1971
01:09:55,440 --> 01:09:58,400
point, you know, it's hard to give

1972
01:09:57,199 --> 01:10:00,239
feedback. It's hard to, you know,

1973
01:09:58,400 --> 01:10:02,400
onboard to a new skill. It's hard to

1974
01:10:00,239 --> 01:10:04,800
kind of uh develop in any sort of

1975
01:10:02,400 --> 01:10:06,800
meaningful way. And so I found that to

1976
01:10:04,800 --> 01:10:08,000
be like the the really critical piece.

1977
01:10:06,800 --> 01:10:09,920
That's a big deal what you just said

1978
01:10:08,000 --> 01:10:11,920
there that essentially as the CPO, head

1979
01:10:09,920 --> 01:10:15,760
of product, big product leader at a

1980
01:10:11,920 --> 01:10:18,320
company. Your interview is not like are

1981
01:10:15,760 --> 01:10:21,760
you an amazing product manager? Are you

1982
01:10:18,320 --> 01:10:24,880
do you have products ta taste? Uh things

1983
01:10:21,760 --> 01:10:25,920
like that. It's growth mindset and and I

1984
01:10:24,880 --> 01:10:27,520
just want to clarify it's because

1985
01:10:25,920 --> 01:10:28,719
everyone that has been you know all the

1986
01:10:27,520 --> 01:10:30,480
other things have been interviewed by

1987
01:10:28,719 --> 01:10:32,080
the designer by the engineering lead

1988
01:10:30,480 --> 01:10:33,520
etc. And that's where that, you know,

1989
01:10:32,080 --> 01:10:35,679
kind of the previous principle comes

1990
01:10:33,520 --> 01:10:37,360
into play as well in terms of I I do

1991
01:10:35,679 --> 01:10:39,600
trust my team to go and assess those

1992
01:10:37,360 --> 01:10:41,199
people, right? But the one thing that I

1993
01:10:39,600 --> 01:10:42,719
care so much about is growth mindset.

1994
01:10:41,199 --> 01:10:44,320
And that's kind of the the thing. And

1995
01:10:42,719 --> 01:10:46,239
and to be honest, I do do a little bit

1996
01:10:44,320 --> 01:10:48,560
of a sweep. So if some we got weak

1997
01:10:46,239 --> 01:10:52,080
signal on one of those areas, I'll do

1998
01:10:48,560 --> 01:10:54,000
it. But the the pure sort of uh focus of

1999
01:10:52,080 --> 01:10:55,360
my last interview is going to be on

2000
01:10:54,000 --> 01:10:57,120
growth mindset. Okay. Well, I need to

2001
01:10:55,360 --> 01:10:59,120
ask you what that looks like. But before

2002
01:10:57,120 --> 01:11:01,360
I do, uh, when you talk about growth

2003
01:10:59,120 --> 01:11:03,520
mindset, I have this, uh, image of Mark

2004
01:11:01,360 --> 01:11:06,239
Beni off on the podcast. And I asked

2005
01:11:03,520 --> 01:11:08,480
them just like there's so much changing

2006
01:11:06,239 --> 01:11:11,199
all the time. It's such a crazy world to

2007
01:11:08,480 --> 01:11:12,719
be leading a company in this world where

2008
01:11:11,199 --> 01:11:14,400
just everyone's disrupting each other.

2009
01:11:12,719 --> 01:11:16,239
AI's changing everything. It's just like

2010
01:11:14,400 --> 01:11:17,760
moving so fast. Every day there's a new,

2011
01:11:16,239 --> 01:11:19,040
you know, breakthrough and you have to

2012
01:11:17,760 --> 01:11:21,360
keep track and just like, how do you

2013
01:11:19,040 --> 01:11:23,760
deal with that? And he's like, you

2014
01:11:21,360 --> 01:11:25,760
should be thinking, good, this is

2015
01:11:23,760 --> 01:11:27,760
amazing. This is the best time to be

2016
01:11:25,760 --> 01:11:29,840
building. There's so much opportunity.

2017
01:11:27,760 --> 01:11:31,679
So exciting. This is what we want.

2018
01:11:29,840 --> 01:11:34,320
Exactly. Good. I just remember seeing

2019
01:11:31,679 --> 01:11:36,000
like good. I love that. I feel like

2020
01:11:34,320 --> 01:11:38,239
that's the epitome of growth mindset.

2021
01:11:36,000 --> 01:11:40,719
Yeah. Absolutely. Okay. So, let me ask

2022
01:11:38,239 --> 01:11:42,640
you just what do you how do you tease

2023
01:11:40,719 --> 01:11:44,400
out a strong growth mindset? What are

2024
01:11:42,640 --> 01:11:45,280
some ways? Well, good thing I'm not an

2025
01:11:44,400 --> 01:11:47,280
operator anymore because I'm going to

2026
01:11:45,280 --> 01:11:49,360
give away my interview questions. So, no

2027
01:11:47,280 --> 01:11:51,040
one can like cheat on this. So, I feel

2028
01:11:49,360 --> 01:11:53,679
like this another reason why this is

2029
01:11:51,040 --> 01:11:55,199
such a great time to do this podcast. Uh

2030
01:11:53,679 --> 01:11:56,960
the question I asked is it's been the

2031
01:11:55,199 --> 01:11:58,880
same one I've asked for years and you

2032
01:11:56,960 --> 01:12:01,840
can really you know kind of sus it out

2033
01:11:58,880 --> 01:12:03,440
from this which is I I asked them

2034
01:12:01,840 --> 01:12:06,159
think about the one of the biggest

2035
01:12:03,440 --> 01:12:10,800
mistakes you've made like truly the most

2036
01:12:06,159 --> 01:12:13,040
the more painful the better and tell me

2037
01:12:10,800 --> 01:12:15,679
what the mistake was describe to me the

2038
01:12:13,040 --> 01:12:18,880
situation and tell me actually how you

2039
01:12:15,679 --> 01:12:21,520
actually think differently now work

2040
01:12:18,880 --> 01:12:23,040
differently as a result like how has

2041
01:12:21,520 --> 01:12:26,320
that turned into a corporate principle

2042
01:12:23,040 --> 01:12:27,920
of yours, etc. And I give them a moment

2043
01:12:26,320 --> 01:12:30,320
to think about it. Sometimes I even

2044
01:12:27,920 --> 01:12:33,280
share some of my mistakes if need be.

2045
01:12:30,320 --> 01:12:35,440
And uh

2046
01:12:33,280 --> 01:12:38,000
it's interesting because because I've

2047
01:12:35,440 --> 01:12:39,600
asked this question so many times, I can

2048
01:12:38,000 --> 01:12:41,920
smell the BS if they're not being

2049
01:12:39,600 --> 01:12:43,440
authentic, right? It's like, you know,

2050
01:12:41,920 --> 01:12:45,760
kind of like, oh, I've worked too hard

2051
01:12:43,440 --> 01:12:47,679
or I, you know, did this thing and

2052
01:12:45,760 --> 01:12:49,600
they're really not being that. You can

2053
01:12:47,679 --> 01:12:51,360
tell the vulnerability that people are

2054
01:12:49,600 --> 01:12:52,640
willing to express and I reciprocate

2055
01:12:51,360 --> 01:12:54,159
with that because if they ask me what

2056
01:12:52,640 --> 01:12:56,080
mine is, I will tell them what it is,

2057
01:12:54,159 --> 01:12:57,440
right? And then that's the vibe. And

2058
01:12:56,080 --> 01:12:59,280
then what ends up happening is like

2059
01:12:57,440 --> 01:13:01,199
there's multiple reasons why this is

2060
01:12:59,280 --> 01:13:03,440
really interesting. One, you get to get

2061
01:13:01,199 --> 01:13:05,520
a sense of how reflective they are. And

2062
01:13:03,440 --> 01:13:06,960
there were some there's one woman I I I

2063
01:13:05,520 --> 01:13:08,320
um was was chatting with and we actually

2064
01:13:06,960 --> 01:13:10,560
went on for like an hour because she was

2065
01:13:08,320 --> 01:13:12,320
just like educating me on this like

2066
01:13:10,560 --> 01:13:14,159
amazing problem that she had made this

2067
01:13:12,320 --> 01:13:15,600
mistake on and like how it changed the

2068
01:13:14,159 --> 01:13:18,239
way that she worked and the company

2069
01:13:15,600 --> 01:13:20,880
worked. It was just incredible, right?

2070
01:13:18,239 --> 01:13:23,040
And you can you can sense the passion.

2071
01:13:20,880 --> 01:13:24,560
You can sense what's genuine, right? And

2072
01:13:23,040 --> 01:13:25,920
then there always once in a while those

2073
01:13:24,560 --> 01:13:27,600
those those things where people are like

2074
01:13:25,920 --> 01:13:31,280
just very a little bit more defensive

2075
01:13:27,600 --> 01:13:32,880
and not willing to open up. Um, and I

2076
01:13:31,280 --> 01:13:34,400
think that's uh and it's safe. It's a

2077
01:13:32,880 --> 01:13:36,719
it's a one-on-one setting, so it's a

2078
01:13:34,400 --> 01:13:38,560
safe space. And I'm, you know, it's also

2079
01:13:36,719 --> 01:13:40,800
it's I don't think it actually selects

2080
01:13:38,560 --> 01:13:42,000
for or against introverts or extroverts.

2081
01:13:40,800 --> 01:13:44,480
I think at that point it's really

2082
01:13:42,000 --> 01:13:46,800
genuine. And the second sort of order

2083
01:13:44,480 --> 01:13:48,159
effect there is if they end up coming on

2084
01:13:46,800 --> 01:13:49,920
the team, you've already had that

2085
01:13:48,159 --> 01:13:51,440
moment.

2086
01:13:49,920 --> 01:13:53,760
You've already had that moment where

2087
01:13:51,440 --> 01:13:56,719
you've just already said like, "Hey,

2088
01:13:53,760 --> 01:13:59,520
like this is where I really messed up."

2089
01:13:56,719 --> 01:14:02,800
And guess what? It's all okay. It's not

2090
01:13:59,520 --> 01:14:04,400
a loss. It's a lesson, right? And so it

2091
01:14:02,800 --> 01:14:06,400
just sets a different tone for your

2092
01:14:04,400 --> 01:14:07,920
working relationship. So again, I've

2093
01:14:06,400 --> 01:14:10,239
never AB tested this, so I can't tell

2094
01:14:07,920 --> 01:14:13,360
you if this is actually you it works or

2095
01:14:10,239 --> 01:14:15,600
not, but I found it to be very helpful

2096
01:14:13,360 --> 01:14:17,120
in the style that I work in to be able

2097
01:14:15,600 --> 01:14:18,719
to have that level of connection whether

2098
01:14:17,120 --> 01:14:20,960
it's with a direct report or somebody in

2099
01:14:18,719 --> 01:14:22,880
the or what I love about this answer is

2100
01:14:20,960 --> 01:14:24,320
it's very much like fail Corner, which

2101
01:14:22,880 --> 01:14:26,159
is a recurring segment on this podcast

2102
01:14:24,320 --> 01:14:29,120
and I might tweak Fail Corner to be even

2103
01:14:26,159 --> 01:14:30,800
closer to this question. Okay. So, let

2104
01:14:29,120 --> 01:14:32,400
me summarize these two. Essentially, two

2105
01:14:30,800 --> 01:14:34,560
questions that you've found to be really

2106
01:14:32,400 --> 01:14:37,040
helpful in finding these superstars that

2107
01:14:34,560 --> 01:14:39,920
you've hired over the years. One is you

2108
01:14:37,040 --> 01:14:42,080
ask people in six months if I'm telling

2109
01:14:39,920 --> 01:14:44,719
you what to do, I've hired the wrong

2110
01:14:42,080 --> 01:14:46,880
person or I guess how do you say it when

2111
01:14:44,719 --> 01:14:48,080
you say it to someone just like you're

2112
01:14:46,880 --> 01:14:49,520
probably the right wrong person? Uh,

2113
01:14:48,080 --> 01:14:50,960
well, it's it's actually framed a little

2114
01:14:49,520 --> 01:14:53,520
bit differently. It's in so there's

2115
01:14:50,960 --> 01:14:55,360
there's five different sort of part of

2116
01:14:53,520 --> 01:14:57,360
my API or just how to work best with me.

2117
01:14:55,360 --> 01:15:00,400
There's like five attributes of people

2118
01:14:57,360 --> 01:15:02,480
that um uh that are most successful who

2119
01:15:00,400 --> 01:15:04,320
who who work with me and I love working

2120
01:15:02,480 --> 01:15:06,800
with and and one of them is framed as

2121
01:15:04,320 --> 01:15:08,719
sort of like you know that that you know

2122
01:15:06,800 --> 01:15:10,159
there you're telling me what to do not

2123
01:15:08,719 --> 01:15:12,000
the other way around six months after

2124
01:15:10,159 --> 01:15:13,600
joining. Right. Right. And then I I

2125
01:15:12,000 --> 01:15:14,800
follow up with in six months if I'm

2126
01:15:13,600 --> 01:15:17,280
still telling what to do I've hired the

2127
01:15:14,800 --> 01:15:19,600
wrong person. Right. And think that is

2128
01:15:17,280 --> 01:15:21,120
that's that's how I frame it. Okay. Uh

2129
01:15:19,600 --> 01:15:25,199
by the way you should open source this

2130
01:15:21,120 --> 01:15:26,800
uh p PXD API doc. I would love to. I

2131
01:15:25,199 --> 01:15:28,400
think now I got nothing to hide. I'm

2132
01:15:26,800 --> 01:15:29,520
just like here I'm an open book. So

2133
01:15:28,400 --> 01:15:30,960
maybe we'll do that at some point.

2134
01:15:29,520 --> 01:15:32,480
You'll you'll you'll make me brave

2135
01:15:30,960 --> 01:15:34,000
enough to do that maybe after this

2136
01:15:32,480 --> 01:15:36,080
podcast. So you may find a link in the

2137
01:15:34,000 --> 01:15:38,880
show notes for this podcast to that doc

2138
01:15:36,080 --> 01:15:40,960
if I'm brave enough. Okay. And then the

2139
01:15:38,880 --> 01:15:44,000
the other question you ask is tell me

2140
01:15:40,960 --> 01:15:45,760
essentially a a story of when you failed

2141
01:15:44,000 --> 01:15:48,159
a product that you launched failed and

2142
01:15:45,760 --> 01:15:50,480
how that changed how you behave, how you

2143
01:15:48,159 --> 01:15:54,320
think about product, how you operate.

2144
01:15:50,480 --> 01:15:57,120
Yeah. Amazing. Okay. Great. Okay. Let's

2145
01:15:54,320 --> 01:15:58,640
talk about management. Sure. So, this

2146
01:15:57,120 --> 01:16:00,080
came up. So, I talked to a bunch of

2147
01:15:58,640 --> 01:16:01,280
people that have worked with you and

2148
01:16:00,080 --> 01:16:03,600
interestingly, one of the most recurring

2149
01:16:01,280 --> 01:16:05,120
themes. It wasn't about like AI or uh

2150
01:16:03,600 --> 01:16:08,080
hiring came up a bit, but it's actually

2151
01:16:05,120 --> 01:16:10,960
mo mostly about how skilled you are as a

2152
01:16:08,080 --> 01:16:12,080
manager. And this has already come

2153
01:16:10,960 --> 01:16:13,760
through in a lot of the things we've

2154
01:16:12,080 --> 01:16:16,159
talked about. So, I want to talk about a

2155
01:16:13,760 --> 01:16:18,159
couple things here. Sure. One is uh

2156
01:16:16,159 --> 01:16:21,120
someone that you worked with at at

2157
01:16:18,159 --> 01:16:24,000
OpenAI, Joanna Jen, or is it Joanne?

2158
01:16:21,120 --> 01:16:26,400
Joanne. Joanne. Joanne Jen or Yang?

2159
01:16:24,000 --> 01:16:28,159
Yeah, Jen. Jen. Okay, cool. You worked

2160
01:16:26,400 --> 01:16:29,520
with her at OpenAI and she shared a

2161
01:16:28,159 --> 01:16:32,159
couple things that I think are really

2162
01:16:29,520 --> 01:16:34,320
interesting. One is that you had a

2163
01:16:32,159 --> 01:16:36,159
profound impact on her career by

2164
01:16:34,320 --> 01:16:37,920
teaching her how to manage up more

2165
01:16:36,159 --> 01:16:39,840
effectively. And you did that by

2166
01:16:37,920 --> 01:16:42,880
teaching her a really simple phrase that

2167
01:16:39,840 --> 01:16:44,880
she just says and uses. First of all, do

2168
01:16:42,880 --> 01:16:46,480
you remember what that phrase is? I've

2169
01:16:44,880 --> 01:16:48,239
said a lot of stuff and I've kind of

2170
01:16:46,480 --> 01:16:50,000
forgotten. I tend to forget what I say.

2171
01:16:48,239 --> 01:16:52,239
So, you might have to remind me. Okay.

2172
01:16:50,000 --> 01:16:54,640
So she said say you'll do the thing do

2173
01:16:52,239 --> 01:16:57,600
the thing say you did the thing. Mhm. As

2174
01:16:54,640 --> 01:16:58,800
a skill of managing up. So sure just

2175
01:16:57,600 --> 01:17:00,400
talk about that just the power of that

2176
01:16:58,800 --> 01:17:03,440
and what that's all about. I mean look I

2177
01:17:00,400 --> 01:17:06,400
I I I learned this from uh my time at

2178
01:17:03,440 --> 01:17:08,239
Uber from Jill who runs uh PR comms and

2179
01:17:06,400 --> 01:17:09,920
policy there and she used to have the

2180
01:17:08,239 --> 01:17:13,440
saying which is like repetition doesn't

2181
01:17:09,920 --> 01:17:16,400
spoil the prayer. It's just a a natural

2182
01:17:13,440 --> 01:17:18,320
thing where people are busy. So whether

2183
01:17:16,400 --> 01:17:21,920
you know if you think about managing up

2184
01:17:18,320 --> 01:17:25,760
or even managing you know the entire org

2185
01:17:21,920 --> 01:17:27,760
if you don't repeat what your goals are

2186
01:17:25,760 --> 01:17:30,239
if you don't repeat what your vision is

2187
01:17:27,760 --> 01:17:32,159
if you don't repeat the thing that you

2188
01:17:30,239 --> 01:17:33,679
feel strongly about that what you're

2189
01:17:32,159 --> 01:17:36,320
doing what you're you know you whether

2190
01:17:33,679 --> 01:17:38,080
it's maybe it's your manager one I think

2191
01:17:36,320 --> 01:17:40,480
you might lose sight of the thing that's

2192
01:17:38,080 --> 01:17:41,920
important and I think this is where it's

2193
01:17:40,480 --> 01:17:44,080
a little bit of a behavior this is

2194
01:17:41,920 --> 01:17:47,199
another language affecting thought thing

2195
01:17:44,080 --> 01:17:49,120
right by uh by by by giving this this

2196
01:17:47,199 --> 01:17:50,239
phrase to Joanne, maybe it was just

2197
01:17:49,120 --> 01:17:51,600
like, hey, let's just be very

2198
01:17:50,239 --> 01:17:54,640
intentional about what we build. That's

2199
01:17:51,600 --> 01:17:58,800
like that becomes a a constant reminder,

2200
01:17:54,640 --> 01:18:00,800
right? And uh and it's also has this

2201
01:17:58,800 --> 01:18:02,640
other effect where uh if you're saying

2202
01:18:00,800 --> 01:18:04,640
this is what I'm doing, and then that's

2203
01:18:02,640 --> 01:18:06,080
a thing that your manager is like, wait,

2204
01:18:04,640 --> 01:18:08,000
we don't need to do that anymore. You

2205
01:18:06,080 --> 01:18:09,760
can have a conversation about that as

2206
01:18:08,000 --> 01:18:11,280
opposed to just like doing the thing and

2207
01:18:09,760 --> 01:18:13,040
not saying that you're doing it. So, let

2208
01:18:11,280 --> 01:18:15,360
me take a step back. So one say what

2209
01:18:13,040 --> 01:18:18,159
you're going to do and then in that in

2210
01:18:15,360 --> 01:18:20,080
that exercise you're going to be able to

2211
01:18:18,159 --> 01:18:22,080
calibrate with your manager again with

2212
01:18:20,080 --> 01:18:23,760
anyone right what is it that we're going

2213
01:18:22,080 --> 01:18:24,960
to do and it's I think the words are

2214
01:18:23,760 --> 01:18:26,880
really important here going back to what

2215
01:18:24,960 --> 01:18:28,960
I said earlier so figuring out what is

2216
01:18:26,880 --> 01:18:32,080
that goal and crafting that to really

2217
01:18:28,960 --> 01:18:34,560
pack the most punch and the densest of

2218
01:18:32,080 --> 01:18:36,719
uh of of uh concepts right and then

2219
01:18:34,560 --> 01:18:38,239
you're telling them that you're doing it

2220
01:18:36,719 --> 01:18:41,520
which that's the second phase which is

2221
01:18:38,239 --> 01:18:43,280
like well in your 101 ones or in your in

2222
01:18:41,520 --> 01:18:44,800
your your your your team all hands,

2223
01:18:43,280 --> 01:18:46,719
you're saying this is what we're doing,

2224
01:18:44,800 --> 01:18:48,560
right? It's a great time to reaffirm

2225
01:18:46,719 --> 01:18:51,360
what you're doing or invite the

2226
01:18:48,560 --> 01:18:53,199
conversation that this is no longer the

2227
01:18:51,360 --> 01:18:54,400
thing to do and you got to tell them

2228
01:18:53,199 --> 01:18:56,320
that you did it. So, just close the

2229
01:18:54,400 --> 01:18:58,800
loop. Just be like, "Okay, great. This

2230
01:18:56,320 --> 01:19:00,000
is now done." Um, and I think that's

2231
01:18:58,800 --> 01:19:02,239
again, it's one of those like really

2232
01:19:00,000 --> 01:19:05,920
piffy phrases that has so many secondord

2233
01:19:02,239 --> 01:19:07,679
effects that are behavioral almost. And

2234
01:19:05,920 --> 01:19:09,520
this is a little bit of a hack in terms

2235
01:19:07,679 --> 01:19:11,040
of helping people. You know, it's funny

2236
01:19:09,520 --> 01:19:13,199
that Joanne thought of it as managing

2237
01:19:11,040 --> 01:19:14,800
up, which is which it is, but in my

2238
01:19:13,199 --> 01:19:16,800
mind, it's almost like this is how we

2239
01:19:14,800 --> 01:19:19,120
operate and this is how we're successful

2240
01:19:16,800 --> 01:19:21,040
to stay on stay on task, stay on goal,

2241
01:19:19,120 --> 01:19:22,880
and be able to revisit the goals that

2242
01:19:21,040 --> 01:19:25,280
we've set when they no longer are

2243
01:19:22,880 --> 01:19:27,600
relevant. Okay, so the phrase again is

2244
01:19:25,280 --> 01:19:30,239
say you'll do the thing, do the thing,

2245
01:19:27,600 --> 01:19:31,520
and then say that you did the thing.

2246
01:19:30,239 --> 01:19:33,760
It's actually Sorry, one more time. It's

2247
01:19:31,520 --> 01:19:35,920
it's it's say it's the way I would say

2248
01:19:33,760 --> 01:19:37,840
it is say you're going to do the thing,

2249
01:19:35,920 --> 01:19:40,080
say that you're doing the thing, and

2250
01:19:37,840 --> 01:19:41,440
then say that you did it. This reminds

2251
01:19:40,080 --> 01:19:43,040
me of uh this also works for

2252
01:19:41,440 --> 01:19:44,640
presentation advice. So, this came up. I

2253
01:19:43,040 --> 01:19:46,800
I don't know if it was Guy Kawasaki or

2254
01:19:44,640 --> 01:19:49,040
someone had a very similar phrase that

2255
01:19:46,800 --> 01:19:50,159
was for how to present well, which is

2256
01:19:49,040 --> 01:19:52,880
tell them what you're going to tell

2257
01:19:50,159 --> 01:19:55,280
them. Tell them and then tell them what

2258
01:19:52,880 --> 01:19:56,719
you just told them. That, you know, it's

2259
01:19:55,280 --> 01:19:58,560
possible that I might have, you know,

2260
01:19:56,719 --> 01:20:00,960
incepted it from there. So, I take no

2261
01:19:58,560 --> 01:20:03,040
ownership over this phrase. I will just

2262
01:20:00,960 --> 01:20:04,800
say that yes, I did I did repeat it.

2263
01:20:03,040 --> 01:20:06,400
This is great. And I love that this

2264
01:20:04,800 --> 01:20:08,640
isn't just managing up advice. It's just

2265
01:20:06,400 --> 01:20:11,679
like operating advice for everyone. And

2266
01:20:08,640 --> 01:20:13,360
there's an implication of uh the last

2267
01:20:11,679 --> 01:20:14,960
part is just like take like make sure

2268
01:20:13,360 --> 01:20:17,120
people know what you did. Like almost

2269
01:20:14,960 --> 01:20:19,120
like make sure you get some credit and

2270
01:20:17,120 --> 01:20:20,320
people understand the impact you've had,

2271
01:20:19,120 --> 01:20:21,760
which is which is important. I think

2272
01:20:20,320 --> 01:20:23,040
there's a lot of people who are kind of

2273
01:20:21,760 --> 01:20:25,520
introverted and don't want to draw

2274
01:20:23,040 --> 01:20:27,440
attention and don't have the hero

2275
01:20:25,520 --> 01:20:30,239
complex. And I think that those people

2276
01:20:27,440 --> 01:20:32,719
tend to get lost in in organizations. So

2277
01:20:30,239 --> 01:20:34,880
if that describes you, just remember to

2278
01:20:32,719 --> 01:20:37,920
to say what you did. There's another

2279
01:20:34,880 --> 01:20:39,280
management trait that Joanne shared that

2280
01:20:37,920 --> 01:20:42,080
I want to spend a little time on, which

2281
01:20:39,280 --> 01:20:43,760
is you're very good at helping people

2282
01:20:42,080 --> 01:20:45,280
understand that they can lean into their

2283
01:20:43,760 --> 01:20:47,440
strengths and not feel like they need to

2284
01:20:45,280 --> 01:20:49,040
fit into a certain box. She shared that

2285
01:20:47,440 --> 01:20:50,800
you basically helped her create almost a

2286
01:20:49,040 --> 01:20:52,880
new role within OpenAI that wasn't even

2287
01:20:50,800 --> 01:20:54,239
a thing before. So just maybe share that

2288
01:20:52,880 --> 01:20:55,760
example and then just talk about why

2289
01:20:54,239 --> 01:20:57,840
this is important, how you think about

2290
01:20:55,760 --> 01:21:00,159
this. Well, I I love that we're talking

2291
01:20:57,840 --> 01:21:02,080
about things that Joan

2292
01:21:00,159 --> 01:21:03,679
are telling you because Joanne's really

2293
01:21:02,080 --> 01:21:07,920
special. I I got to just take a moment

2294
01:21:03,679 --> 01:21:10,000
to give her a giant shout out. She is

2295
01:21:07,920 --> 01:21:12,960
uh the only person that I've worked with

2296
01:21:10,000 --> 01:21:15,360
that has as much technical depth as she

2297
01:21:12,960 --> 01:21:16,800
does have product taste.

2298
01:21:15,360 --> 01:21:18,159
And I just want to pause there like it's

2299
01:21:16,800 --> 01:21:19,760
it's just truly special. I I feel

2300
01:21:18,159 --> 01:21:21,760
entirely privileged to have the chance

2301
01:21:19,760 --> 01:21:23,760
to cross paths with her at opening eye.

2302
01:21:21,760 --> 01:21:25,760
I learned so much from her. Like again,

2303
01:21:23,760 --> 01:21:27,360
t talk about like not telling you what

2304
01:21:25,760 --> 01:21:29,280
to do after 6 months. Like she was

2305
01:21:27,360 --> 01:21:32,000
telling me what to do from like day two

2306
01:21:29,280 --> 01:21:33,600
and I loved it because she was she's so

2307
01:21:32,000 --> 01:21:35,360
technical and she has this taste and

2308
01:21:33,600 --> 01:21:36,960
that those two things are very rare to

2309
01:21:35,360 --> 01:21:38,480
find together. And with Joanne because

2310
01:21:36,960 --> 01:21:40,320
she was so special in that way and I

2311
01:21:38,480 --> 01:21:42,159
spotted that I was like wow like I've

2312
01:21:40,320 --> 01:21:45,040
worked with so many PMs and it just like

2313
01:21:42,159 --> 01:21:46,640
this is very unique. It just it feel

2314
01:21:45,040 --> 01:21:49,280
felt like we had to find a way to craft

2315
01:21:46,640 --> 01:21:50,640
this, right? And sure enough, she was I

2316
01:21:49,280 --> 01:21:52,560
was like, "Hey, can you just write up a

2317
01:21:50,640 --> 01:21:54,159
job description of like what is this

2318
01:21:52,560 --> 01:21:56,719
thing?" Because there's something

2319
01:21:54,159 --> 01:21:59,600
magical here, but I don't fully

2320
01:21:56,719 --> 01:22:01,040
understand it. I don't think any other

2321
01:21:59,600 --> 01:22:02,800
person really thinks of things this way

2322
01:22:01,040 --> 01:22:05,920
and think this might be a big superpower

2323
01:22:02,800 --> 01:22:09,040
for OpenAI. Like, let's codify it,

2324
01:22:05,920 --> 01:22:11,360
right? And again going back to my

2325
01:22:09,040 --> 01:22:13,120
language being a really important thing,

2326
01:22:11,360 --> 01:22:15,120
I think the exercise sometimes of

2327
01:22:13,120 --> 01:22:17,679
writing things down of like things that

2328
01:22:15,120 --> 01:22:19,440
you intuitively feel give you an

2329
01:22:17,679 --> 01:22:21,040
artifact that can kind of communicate

2330
01:22:19,440 --> 01:22:23,199
with somebody else. So like in this case

2331
01:22:21,040 --> 01:22:24,880
Joanne writing down like kind of some of

2332
01:22:23,199 --> 01:22:28,080
the things that she got really excited

2333
01:22:24,880 --> 01:22:30,800
about helped me really understand that

2334
01:22:28,080 --> 01:22:32,080
and you know I was luckily in a in a

2335
01:22:30,800 --> 01:22:33,520
position where I can basically say like

2336
01:22:32,080 --> 01:22:35,520
let's let's create this role. let's

2337
01:22:33,520 --> 01:22:38,159
let's let's create this role and have

2338
01:22:35,520 --> 01:22:41,280
you lead it and I think this is going to

2339
01:22:38,159 --> 01:22:43,840
be great for the product if we're able

2340
01:22:41,280 --> 01:22:45,440
to codify it. So I don't think I did

2341
01:22:43,840 --> 01:22:47,520
anything special. I was just following

2342
01:22:45,440 --> 01:22:50,000
my instincts and just like following her

2343
01:22:47,520 --> 01:22:52,159
lead. Again, I will be clear. I did not

2344
01:22:50,000 --> 01:22:54,159
author that document. I my recollection

2345
01:22:52,159 --> 01:22:56,480
she did that. So she did all the hard

2346
01:22:54,159 --> 01:22:57,679
work and all of this thing and I don't

2347
01:22:56,480 --> 01:22:59,040
want to take any credit for it. The only

2348
01:22:57,679 --> 01:23:00,719
thing I did was just gave her a little

2349
01:22:59,040 --> 01:23:02,800
nudge of like I think there's something

2350
01:23:00,719 --> 01:23:04,880
here like can you just take a moment to

2351
01:23:02,800 --> 01:23:06,480
go and write this down and when she did

2352
01:23:04,880 --> 01:23:08,880
it was just like okay this has got to be

2353
01:23:06,480 --> 01:23:10,480
a role and you have to be the leader for

2354
01:23:08,880 --> 01:23:11,679
this function. What is the actual role

2355
01:23:10,480 --> 01:23:12,800
she ended up in? I think that'd be

2356
01:23:11,679 --> 01:23:15,199
really interesting to share. Yeah, the

2357
01:23:12,800 --> 01:23:17,920
role was model designer. Um, and it was

2358
01:23:15,199 --> 01:23:20,080
just a really interesting way that she

2359
01:23:17,920 --> 01:23:22,239
framed it and and I know this role

2360
01:23:20,080 --> 01:23:24,159
probably exists in some incarnation in

2361
01:23:22,239 --> 01:23:25,840
other uh uh foundational model

2362
01:23:24,159 --> 01:23:27,679
companies, but the way that she

2363
01:23:25,840 --> 01:23:31,120
described it and the things that she

2364
01:23:27,679 --> 01:23:34,320
found to be the spikes required led us

2365
01:23:31,120 --> 01:23:35,840
to hire our first two model designers

2366
01:23:34,320 --> 01:23:37,600
after running a search and they were

2367
01:23:35,840 --> 01:23:41,679
just perfect fits for the team, right?

2368
01:23:37,600 --> 01:23:44,560
Um, and that I think is is largely a big

2369
01:23:41,679 --> 01:23:46,320
secret as to why I'm biased. I love

2370
01:23:44,560 --> 01:23:48,960
Chachi Piti so much in the way the model

2371
01:23:46,320 --> 01:23:51,280
design comes off. Um, and and the vibe

2372
01:23:48,960 --> 01:23:54,159
of the model is largely because of this

2373
01:23:51,280 --> 01:23:56,480
like technical plus taste role that she

2374
01:23:54,159 --> 01:23:58,480
has created and she is leading. I love

2375
01:23:56,480 --> 01:24:00,400
one of the interesting takeaways from

2376
01:23:58,480 --> 01:24:02,000
this is as a leader is just pay

2377
01:24:00,400 --> 01:24:04,080
attention to some to what people are

2378
01:24:02,000 --> 01:24:05,920
really really excited about and then

2379
01:24:04,080 --> 01:24:08,320
take the step of let them try to

2380
01:24:05,920 --> 01:24:10,000
describe it very clearly in a dock

2381
01:24:08,320 --> 01:24:11,600
coming back to your point about the the

2382
01:24:10,000 --> 01:24:13,199
power of language and words is just like

2383
01:24:11,600 --> 01:24:14,800
okay tell me exactly what you're

2384
01:24:13,199 --> 01:24:17,120
thinking and let's jam on it because

2385
01:24:14,800 --> 01:24:18,239
maybe there's something here. Yeah. Is

2386
01:24:17,120 --> 01:24:19,840
there anything broader here about just

2387
01:24:18,239 --> 01:24:21,120
like leaning into strength that you find

2388
01:24:19,840 --> 01:24:22,800
just like you know there's a lot of

2389
01:24:21,120 --> 01:24:24,159
people there's all this debate of like

2390
01:24:22,800 --> 01:24:25,840
should I just work on the things I'm

2391
01:24:24,159 --> 01:24:27,600
terrible at and that'll make me better

2392
01:24:25,840 --> 01:24:28,880
or should I find the things I'm amazing

2393
01:24:27,600 --> 01:24:30,719
at and just get better at those things.

2394
01:24:28,880 --> 01:24:34,080
Any thoughts there? I genuinely believe

2395
01:24:30,719 --> 01:24:36,159
that fit is a two-way street. And so

2396
01:24:34,080 --> 01:24:38,400
what you are passionate about, what your

2397
01:24:36,159 --> 01:24:40,560
strengths are, you got to really find

2398
01:24:38,400 --> 01:24:42,880
the right company, the right role for

2399
01:24:40,560 --> 01:24:44,960
you. And I think there's a lot of

2400
01:24:42,880 --> 01:24:47,120
force-fitting that people want to do is

2401
01:24:44,960 --> 01:24:48,880
to fit into a certain archetype. I'm

2402
01:24:47,120 --> 01:24:50,719
glad we talked about the PM archetypes.

2403
01:24:48,880 --> 01:24:52,960
Hopefully that frees people up to kind

2404
01:24:50,719 --> 01:24:55,360
of really lean into what they love,

2405
01:24:52,960 --> 01:24:56,800
right? Because, you know, life's pretty

2406
01:24:55,360 --> 01:24:58,159
short. It would be it'd be great if

2407
01:24:56,800 --> 01:25:00,239
everyone would find the thing that they

2408
01:24:58,159 --> 01:25:02,880
really wanted to do and be able to lean

2409
01:25:00,239 --> 01:25:05,120
in and do that. And I think the optimist

2410
01:25:02,880 --> 01:25:07,040
in me is also why this is I'm so excited

2411
01:25:05,120 --> 01:25:09,040
about the time and age that we're in

2412
01:25:07,040 --> 01:25:10,239
right now because there's so many

2413
01:25:09,040 --> 01:25:11,360
different companies popping up. So

2414
01:25:10,239 --> 01:25:12,880
there's like there's there's something

2415
01:25:11,360 --> 01:25:14,320
that really resonates with people,

2416
01:25:12,880 --> 01:25:16,159
right? I mean, take a look at just the

2417
01:25:14,320 --> 01:25:18,480
the you know, we're doing here. It's

2418
01:25:16,159 --> 01:25:20,639
like podcasting was not a thing 20 years

2419
01:25:18,480 --> 01:25:23,840
ago. Like we there's there was it was

2420
01:25:20,639 --> 01:25:25,600
not a thing. But now we're able to like

2421
01:25:23,840 --> 01:25:27,679
have these amazing tools and platforms

2422
01:25:25,600 --> 01:25:29,360
that allow people to really express

2423
01:25:27,679 --> 01:25:31,520
themselves and really what really truly

2424
01:25:29,360 --> 01:25:33,760
brings them joy and and makes them happy

2425
01:25:31,520 --> 01:25:36,480
uh and also brings a ton of value uh to

2426
01:25:33,760 --> 01:25:37,600
the world, right? So I think that yeah I

2427
01:25:36,480 --> 01:25:39,199
definitely believe in leaning in

2428
01:25:37,600 --> 01:25:40,800
strengths and I think that you know as

2429
01:25:39,199 --> 01:25:43,120
hard as it may be sometimes you got to

2430
01:25:40,800 --> 01:25:44,960
look at sort of where you are right now

2431
01:25:43,120 --> 01:25:47,120
and is this the thing that you really

2432
01:25:44,960 --> 01:25:49,360
want to do or is there something else

2433
01:25:47,120 --> 01:25:50,960
that's kind of like kind of uh drawing

2434
01:25:49,360 --> 01:25:52,800
your attention and and drawing you

2435
01:25:50,960 --> 01:25:54,239
towards that. There's another

2436
01:25:52,800 --> 01:25:57,600
managementoriented question I want to

2437
01:25:54,239 --> 01:25:59,280
ask you. This came from Eric Antel who

2438
01:25:57,600 --> 01:26:00,880
uh apparently has worked with you for 17

2439
01:25:59,280 --> 01:26:03,360
years across a bunch of off and on for

2440
01:26:00,880 --> 01:26:05,679
17 years. one of my my biggest uh

2441
01:26:03,360 --> 01:26:08,239
mentors and friends like he's amazing.

2442
01:26:05,679 --> 01:26:09,840
Okay, so he's he he he's like you need

2443
01:26:08,239 --> 01:26:12,560
to ask this question. So the way he put

2444
01:26:09,840 --> 01:26:14,800
it is you've hired, managed, mentored

2445
01:26:12,560 --> 01:26:17,120
many, many, many product people, some

2446
01:26:14,800 --> 01:26:19,520
junior, some senior, across so many

2447
01:26:17,120 --> 01:26:21,120
different cultures. And he's just like,

2448
01:26:19,520 --> 01:26:23,280
we need to learn something from your

2449
01:26:21,120 --> 01:26:25,360
experience doing that. Uh, in terms of

2450
01:26:23,280 --> 01:26:26,960
what you've learned about what it takes

2451
01:26:25,360 --> 01:26:30,080
to be a really successful product

2452
01:26:26,960 --> 01:26:32,719
person, whether it's being successful in

2453
01:26:30,080 --> 01:26:34,719
building product or career-wise, what's

2454
01:26:32,719 --> 01:26:36,400
just like a nugget that you learn from

2455
01:26:34,719 --> 01:26:38,480
seeing so many different types of people

2456
01:26:36,400 --> 01:26:41,280
and cultures and seniority? I think for

2457
01:26:38,480 --> 01:26:44,880
a product person specifically,

2458
01:26:41,280 --> 01:26:47,280
it's really important to obsess over the

2459
01:26:44,880 --> 01:26:49,040
details of craft because you're

2460
01:26:47,280 --> 01:26:51,520
ultimately you're crafting a product.

2461
01:26:49,040 --> 01:26:54,719
It's important to obsess about the

2462
01:26:51,520 --> 01:26:57,520
details of craft while simultaneously

2463
01:26:54,719 --> 01:27:01,920
having the perspective and wisdom of

2464
01:26:57,520 --> 01:27:03,199
which details don't actually matter.

2465
01:27:01,920 --> 01:27:06,320
I'm going to pause there and just kind

2466
01:27:03,199 --> 01:27:07,920
of try to unpack this a little bit

2467
01:27:06,320 --> 01:27:09,600
because at the core of being a product

2468
01:27:07,920 --> 01:27:11,520
person, you're like, "Oh, like I want to

2469
01:27:09,600 --> 01:27:15,040
build something that people love,

2470
01:27:11,520 --> 01:27:17,040
right?" And

2471
01:27:15,040 --> 01:27:18,639
that's the job and that's that's what

2472
01:27:17,040 --> 01:27:21,600
draws people to be product people is

2473
01:27:18,639 --> 01:27:24,800
that you have this desire to build. And

2474
01:27:21,600 --> 01:27:26,719
I think that

2475
01:27:24,800 --> 01:27:29,199
I've been

2476
01:27:26,719 --> 01:27:30,639
involved in enough teams where I myself

2477
01:27:29,199 --> 01:27:31,840
and when I was really young and and

2478
01:27:30,639 --> 01:27:33,120
coming up as a product person, I would

2479
01:27:31,840 --> 01:27:35,280
just get obsessed over these little

2480
01:27:33,120 --> 01:27:37,199
little details and I've I realized

2481
01:27:35,280 --> 01:27:38,320
afterwards that we just wasted a bunch

2482
01:27:37,199 --> 01:27:41,040
of time on something that didn't

2483
01:27:38,320 --> 01:27:44,080
actually matter. So I think that

2484
01:27:41,040 --> 01:27:47,040
dichotomy is somewhat

2485
01:27:44,080 --> 01:27:50,000
interesting and beautiful to me because

2486
01:27:47,040 --> 01:27:51,760
it encapsulates both the core of what

2487
01:27:50,000 --> 01:27:53,360
the ethos

2488
01:27:51,760 --> 01:27:55,679
of a successful product person is, which

2489
01:27:53,360 --> 01:27:57,520
is you really have to care and you have

2490
01:27:55,679 --> 01:27:59,280
to to give a crap about the product that

2491
01:27:57,520 --> 01:28:00,880
you're building.

2492
01:27:59,280 --> 01:28:02,480
But you also have to have the

2493
01:28:00,880 --> 01:28:04,000
perspective and business knowhow to

2494
01:28:02,480 --> 01:28:06,719
understand where do you apply your time

2495
01:28:04,000 --> 01:28:08,800
and where do you apply the care there.

2496
01:28:06,719 --> 01:28:10,639
And I myself feel like I've gone through

2497
01:28:08,800 --> 01:28:12,400
cycles, you know, like everything that

2498
01:28:10,639 --> 01:28:15,360
I've done, I've gone super deep and

2499
01:28:12,400 --> 01:28:18,560
really obsessed and then I take a step

2500
01:28:15,360 --> 01:28:20,239
back and I'm like, wait, actually, I was

2501
01:28:18,560 --> 01:28:22,880
missing something and this other thing

2502
01:28:20,239 --> 01:28:24,320
was was more important, right? I I'll

2503
01:28:22,880 --> 01:28:28,320
give you an example. I'll use the Uber

2504
01:28:24,320 --> 01:28:29,600
example here as as um as you know what I

2505
01:28:28,320 --> 01:28:31,120
said that you know that the digital

2506
01:28:29,600 --> 01:28:33,679
product didn't really matter, right? And

2507
01:28:31,120 --> 01:28:35,679
it was all about the price, the ETA.

2508
01:28:33,679 --> 01:28:38,400
one of the proudest products I've built

2509
01:28:35,679 --> 01:28:39,920
at Uber, which is Uber Reserve, right?

2510
01:28:38,400 --> 01:28:41,280
It's the simplest of thing. Going back

2511
01:28:39,920 --> 01:28:42,639
to what I said before, sometimes the

2512
01:28:41,280 --> 01:28:44,400
best products are the simplest of

2513
01:28:42,639 --> 01:28:46,000
things. But the problem that we were

2514
01:28:44,400 --> 01:28:48,080
trying to solve is that, you know,

2515
01:28:46,000 --> 01:28:49,679
everyone has this. You have a 6 a.m.

2516
01:28:48,080 --> 01:28:51,840
flight

2517
01:28:49,679 --> 01:28:54,560
and are you really going to wake up at

2518
01:28:51,840 --> 01:28:56,400
4:00 a.m. and request an Uber and hope

2519
01:28:54,560 --> 01:28:58,800
that there's enough Ubers and the person

2520
01:28:56,400 --> 01:29:00,159
is going to come, right? because if you

2521
01:28:58,800 --> 01:29:01,360
do that, you're not going to sleep well

2522
01:29:00,159 --> 01:29:03,120
and you're going to like, you know, wake

2523
01:29:01,360 --> 01:29:04,000
up every two hours and you're you're

2524
01:29:03,120 --> 01:29:05,040
probably going to miss your flight

2525
01:29:04,000 --> 01:29:06,719
anyway because you're going to fall

2526
01:29:05,040 --> 01:29:08,880
asleep or whatever. And so there was

2527
01:29:06,719 --> 01:29:10,480
this insight of like, okay, there's a

2528
01:29:08,880 --> 01:29:12,800
whole mismatch between what people

2529
01:29:10,480 --> 01:29:14,239
really want, which is the the peace of

2530
01:29:12,800 --> 01:29:16,639
mind that their car is going to be

2531
01:29:14,239 --> 01:29:19,199
there, and guess what? I'm willing to

2532
01:29:16,639 --> 01:29:20,960
pay for that, right? And so we built

2533
01:29:19,199 --> 01:29:22,239
Uber Reserve which was like it was the

2534
01:29:20,960 --> 01:29:24,400
simplest thing which is like oh just

2535
01:29:22,239 --> 01:29:26,400
like go ahead and say what time your

2536
01:29:24,400 --> 01:29:27,679
flight is and we'll work backwards or

2537
01:29:26,400 --> 01:29:30,639
even just like tell us when you want to

2538
01:29:27,679 --> 01:29:32,719
get picked up and everything about that

2539
01:29:30,639 --> 01:29:34,400
product we crafted what really mattered

2540
01:29:32,719 --> 01:29:36,400
for the user which was the peace of

2541
01:29:34,400 --> 01:29:38,320
mind. So if you go there and you say

2542
01:29:36,400 --> 01:29:39,760
what time your flight is and you you

2543
01:29:38,320 --> 01:29:41,600
pick up your your pickup time or

2544
01:29:39,760 --> 01:29:42,960
whatever I think that the product is it

2545
01:29:41,600 --> 01:29:44,880
hasn't changed that much since I was

2546
01:29:42,960 --> 01:29:46,719
since I was there. It would tell you oh

2547
01:29:44,880 --> 01:29:48,480
this is cutting it really close. You may

2548
01:29:46,719 --> 01:29:50,560
not make your flight. It's like, wow.

2549
01:29:48,480 --> 01:29:53,120
Again, that was put in there because of

2550
01:29:50,560 --> 01:29:54,639
the principle of peace of mind, right?

2551
01:29:53,120 --> 01:29:55,920
And and on the other side, it's like,

2552
01:29:54,639 --> 01:29:56,880
well, what do drivers need? They need to

2553
01:29:55,920 --> 01:29:58,159
they need to know you're not going to

2554
01:29:56,880 --> 01:29:58,880
cancel and all this other stuff. So, you

2555
01:29:58,159 --> 01:30:00,800
got to think about the driver

2556
01:29:58,880 --> 01:30:02,800
incentives, too. So, it was a simple

2557
01:30:00,800 --> 01:30:04,480
idea. Uh really proud of the team for

2558
01:30:02,800 --> 01:30:06,960
figuring out all the intricate details.

2559
01:30:04,480 --> 01:30:08,560
Did some testing. And last I heard from

2560
01:30:06,960 --> 01:30:10,320
folks internally, this is like a $5

2561
01:30:08,560 --> 01:30:12,239
billion a year business now and one of

2562
01:30:10,320 --> 01:30:13,600
the highest margin ones. And I'm really

2563
01:30:12,239 --> 01:30:15,440
proud of this because it's like it came

2564
01:30:13,600 --> 01:30:17,440
from the idea of like, let's focus on

2565
01:30:15,440 --> 01:30:19,120
what actually matters, right? which is

2566
01:30:17,440 --> 01:30:21,040
this that peace of mind and how many

2567
01:30:19,120 --> 01:30:22,719
people really need it in that moment.

2568
01:30:21,040 --> 01:30:24,320
So, so that I think that's a story that

2569
01:30:22,719 --> 01:30:26,719
the best the best story I can tell.

2570
01:30:24,320 --> 01:30:27,920
That's an awesome story. Uh it connects

2571
01:30:26,719 --> 01:30:30,719
so many of the things you've talked

2572
01:30:27,920 --> 01:30:32,239
about. One is just uh it may not be the

2573
01:30:30,719 --> 01:30:34,000
product that really matters and

2574
01:30:32,239 --> 01:30:36,000
microoptimizing the experience is not

2575
01:30:34,000 --> 01:30:37,920
going to move the needle when there's

2576
01:30:36,000 --> 01:30:39,120
something else that's more operationally

2577
01:30:37,920 --> 01:30:40,159
oriented. But, you know, there's always

2578
01:30:39,120 --> 01:30:41,840
going to be a product component if

2579
01:30:40,159 --> 01:30:42,960
you're building it for for users. The

2580
01:30:41,840 --> 01:30:45,280
other piece that I think is interesting

2581
01:30:42,960 --> 01:30:46,800
here is it's uh well, there's two. One

2582
01:30:45,280 --> 01:30:49,679
is just it connects back to your point

2583
01:30:46,800 --> 01:30:52,000
about the importance of autonomy of

2584
01:30:49,679 --> 01:30:53,600
product people is just like I feel like

2585
01:30:52,000 --> 01:30:55,120
you're like here's the team here's what

2586
01:30:53,600 --> 01:30:57,280
I'm told to work on and then you're like

2587
01:30:55,120 --> 01:30:59,199
oh but this thing is actually the

2588
01:30:57,280 --> 01:31:00,639
problem we need to solve and let's just

2589
01:30:59,199 --> 01:31:02,159
build a new product around it and then

2590
01:31:00,639 --> 01:31:04,000
there's a whole story imagine of you

2591
01:31:02,159 --> 01:31:05,040
getting buying and all that stuff. The

2592
01:31:04,000 --> 01:31:06,800
other thing this connects to, we just

2593
01:31:05,040 --> 01:31:08,960
had the CPO of the of Uber, the current

2594
01:31:06,800 --> 01:31:10,880
CPO of Uber on the podcast, and he

2595
01:31:08,960 --> 01:31:12,560
talked that'll be out a few episodes

2596
01:31:10,880 --> 01:31:15,679
before this one, and he's it was all

2597
01:31:12,560 --> 01:31:17,600
about dog fooding and basically exactly

2598
01:31:15,679 --> 01:31:21,520
discovering these problems. He he's done

2599
01:31:17,600 --> 01:31:22,880
7 to 800 rides as an Uber driver to do

2600
01:31:21,520 --> 01:31:25,040
to discover these problems. He had this

2601
01:31:22,880 --> 01:31:27,280
great quote about uh it's like one thing

2602
01:31:25,040 --> 01:31:28,880
to watch to build an app for drivers

2603
01:31:27,280 --> 01:31:30,560
sitting in your office making it look

2604
01:31:28,880 --> 01:31:32,320
really pretty. It's another to be

2605
01:31:30,560 --> 01:31:33,760
driving 60 miles an hour with this phone

2606
01:31:32,320 --> 01:31:37,199
a few feet away from you trying to

2607
01:31:33,760 --> 01:31:40,000
figure things out. 100%. Oh, I remember

2608
01:31:37,199 --> 01:31:43,040
that I I took um two weeks off before I

2609
01:31:40,000 --> 01:31:44,560
joined Uber and in that time I've I've

2610
01:31:43,040 --> 01:31:46,400
been obsessed with kind of like user

2611
01:31:44,560 --> 01:31:48,000
research for the the longest of times

2612
01:31:46,400 --> 01:31:50,080
and this is like more relevant back then

2613
01:31:48,000 --> 01:31:53,520
when you wanted to really understand how

2614
01:31:50,080 --> 01:31:56,480
you know you the wide uh mass of uh

2615
01:31:53,520 --> 01:31:58,800
users were using your product. Um, and I

2616
01:31:56,480 --> 01:32:00,639
remember I actually leased a car to to

2617
01:31:58,800 --> 01:32:05,199
drive for Uber those two weeks. Um, so

2618
01:32:00,639 --> 01:32:07,920
it was a little white uh uh VW something

2619
01:32:05,199 --> 01:32:09,600
or another. I put an Uber sticker on it.

2620
01:32:07,920 --> 01:32:11,760
I turn on the app and I just started

2621
01:32:09,600 --> 01:32:14,880
driving. It's like there's no better way

2622
01:32:11,760 --> 01:32:16,960
to learn than to dog food. And I'll just

2623
01:32:14,880 --> 01:32:18,159
build on what what Sachin Sachin, right?

2624
01:32:16,960 --> 01:32:20,320
This is the person you had on on the

2625
01:32:18,159 --> 01:32:22,159
podcast. Yeah. It's amazing amazing guy.

2626
01:32:20,320 --> 01:32:24,320
And and so I'll just build on sort of

2627
01:32:22,159 --> 01:32:25,920
what he said there. I think that, you

2628
01:32:24,320 --> 01:32:28,960
know, what really stuck with me in terms

2629
01:32:25,920 --> 01:32:31,760
of framework that

2630
01:32:28,960 --> 01:32:34,480
I learned back in school was cuz I was

2631
01:32:31,760 --> 01:32:36,960
brought up at with the ideo way of

2632
01:32:34,480 --> 01:32:39,840
design thinking. Um, and I was at the

2633
01:32:36,960 --> 01:32:41,440
design school at Stanford where before,

2634
01:32:39,840 --> 01:32:43,280
you know, we literally were in uh

2635
01:32:41,440 --> 01:32:46,480
trailers. Uh, that's that's that's how

2636
01:32:43,280 --> 01:32:48,239
early it was. But I remember the the

2637
01:32:46,480 --> 01:32:50,080
framework that really stuck with me is

2638
01:32:48,239 --> 01:32:51,920
what IDO preached, which is like there

2639
01:32:50,080 --> 01:32:55,920
are five stages to great design

2640
01:32:51,920 --> 01:32:59,679
thinking. Number one is empathize.

2641
01:32:55,920 --> 01:33:02,480
Two is to define. Three is to ideulate.

2642
01:32:59,679 --> 01:33:04,400
Four is to prototype. And and five is to

2643
01:33:02,480 --> 01:33:06,000
test. And what I love about this

2644
01:33:04,400 --> 01:33:07,600
framework and I really hope this doesn't

2645
01:33:06,000 --> 01:33:10,080
get lost because I I don't know how much

2646
01:33:07,600 --> 01:33:12,560
it's being preached nowadays in in

2647
01:33:10,080 --> 01:33:14,639
design thinking is that it really it has

2648
01:33:12,560 --> 01:33:16,239
the right words associated with it. You

2649
01:33:14,639 --> 01:33:18,800
know, like the first thing is

2650
01:33:16,239 --> 01:33:20,320
empathizing. Like it's not just about

2651
01:33:18,800 --> 01:33:21,840
you got to really feel the pain of your

2652
01:33:20,320 --> 01:33:24,159
customers, right? It's not just about

2653
01:33:21,840 --> 01:33:26,320
kind of theoretically understanding what

2654
01:33:24,159 --> 01:33:28,400
the problems are. It's like really

2655
01:33:26,320 --> 01:33:30,800
empathizing which is why you know user

2656
01:33:28,400 --> 01:33:33,360
research was so important to me right is

2657
01:33:30,800 --> 01:33:35,440
to understand that or even you know like

2658
01:33:33,360 --> 01:33:37,600
Sachin said just taking those rides but

2659
01:33:35,440 --> 01:33:39,120
also you know flying around the world

2660
01:33:37,600 --> 01:33:41,440
and and when I was working at Uber to

2661
01:33:39,120 --> 01:33:43,040
figure out well what are the various

2662
01:33:41,440 --> 01:33:44,480
conditions

2663
01:33:43,040 --> 01:33:46,880
and so empathize is like a really

2664
01:33:44,480 --> 01:33:49,840
powerful word. The define is a also a

2665
01:33:46,880 --> 01:33:52,320
really powerful word because it forces

2666
01:33:49,840 --> 01:33:53,520
you to articulate what the problem is.

2667
01:33:52,320 --> 01:33:55,040
And this is again going back to the

2668
01:33:53,520 --> 01:33:58,400
language thing of you have to be very

2669
01:33:55,040 --> 01:34:00,320
intentional about defining the um the

2670
01:33:58,400 --> 01:34:01,760
the the problems that you want to solve.

2671
01:34:00,320 --> 01:34:03,199
And then ID8 we all know it's

2672
01:34:01,760 --> 01:34:04,719
brainstorming and prototyping and tests

2673
01:34:03,199 --> 01:34:07,520
are self-explanatory. But the first two

2674
01:34:04,719 --> 01:34:10,000
stages I think are really insightful um

2675
01:34:07,520 --> 01:34:11,280
and it talks directly to what Sachin was

2676
01:34:10,000 --> 01:34:13,920
saying. It's like you got a dog food

2677
01:34:11,280 --> 01:34:16,080
because you really have to empathize and

2678
01:34:13,920 --> 01:34:18,000
the great products are when you really

2679
01:34:16,080 --> 01:34:19,840
feel the pain and you really empath

2680
01:34:18,000 --> 01:34:21,600
empathize with the with with what people

2681
01:34:19,840 --> 01:34:23,120
are are experiencing. This is a great

2682
01:34:21,600 --> 01:34:25,120
connection to another podcast episode

2683
01:34:23,120 --> 01:34:27,360
that I I came to mind as you were

2684
01:34:25,120 --> 01:34:29,360
talking uh the head of product at linear

2685
01:34:27,360 --> 01:34:30,880
naan had this really great concept

2686
01:34:29,360 --> 01:34:32,960
that's exactly what you're just saying

2687
01:34:30,880 --> 01:34:35,280
which is as a product person you want to

2688
01:34:32,960 --> 01:34:37,600
feel the pain of your customer the same

2689
01:34:35,280 --> 01:34:39,600
way they do. You shouldn't stop asking

2690
01:34:37,600 --> 01:34:41,280
questions to understand what they're

2691
01:34:39,600 --> 01:34:42,960
telling you until you feel the pain that

2692
01:34:41,280 --> 01:34:44,320
they feel and that'll help you empath

2693
01:34:42,960 --> 01:34:47,120
that basically that's like how to

2694
01:34:44,320 --> 01:34:48,719
operationalize empathizing. It's just do

2695
01:34:47,120 --> 01:34:50,960
you feel the suffering. Yeah. And I

2696
01:34:48,719 --> 01:34:52,159
really do hope um product people still

2697
01:34:50,960 --> 01:34:53,840
do this to this day because I think

2698
01:34:52,159 --> 01:34:55,280
there's so many shortcuts that if people

2699
01:34:53,840 --> 01:34:57,120
take you're going to miss the point,

2700
01:34:55,280 --> 01:34:59,440
right? I still remember distinctly

2701
01:34:57,120 --> 01:35:02,560
flying down to LA with Kevin Cyester to

2702
01:34:59,440 --> 01:35:04,320
go do a user research study. Uh, and it

2703
01:35:02,560 --> 01:35:06,239
was a one-way glass thing where we

2704
01:35:04,320 --> 01:35:08,480
listened to pe uh people talk about

2705
01:35:06,239 --> 01:35:10,880
Instagram and how they use Instagram and

2706
01:35:08,480 --> 01:35:13,600
it was there's no substitute for that,

2707
01:35:10,880 --> 01:35:15,760
right? I think that if to anyone out

2708
01:35:13,600 --> 01:35:17,360
there who's like doing user interviews

2709
01:35:15,760 --> 01:35:19,040
and then saying, "Hey, Chachi PT,

2710
01:35:17,360 --> 01:35:22,000
summarize the takeaways." You're missing

2711
01:35:19,040 --> 01:35:25,520
the point. You can't empathize with the

2712
01:35:22,000 --> 01:35:28,239
summary. You have to be in the room

2713
01:35:25,520 --> 01:35:30,320
fully immersed, no phones, just actually

2714
01:35:28,239 --> 01:35:31,440
hearing the words and the intonation.

2715
01:35:30,320 --> 01:35:34,000
That's how you're going to get the full

2716
01:35:31,440 --> 01:35:35,920
color. So, yeah, it makes me think of

2717
01:35:34,000 --> 01:35:37,520
Jeff Bezos has this great quote. If

2718
01:35:35,920 --> 01:35:38,639
you're trying to if you have an anecdote

2719
01:35:37,520 --> 01:35:42,080
and data and they're telling you

2720
01:35:38,639 --> 01:35:46,159
different things, trust the anecdote.

2721
01:35:42,080 --> 01:35:47,199
Oh, man. So many lessons. Okay, so to

2722
01:35:46,159 --> 01:35:48,800
start to kind of wrap up our

2723
01:35:47,199 --> 01:35:50,320
conversation, we covered a lot of

2724
01:35:48,800 --> 01:35:53,280
ground. I want to ask you about Facebook

2725
01:35:50,320 --> 01:35:56,239
real quick. So you joined Facebook very

2726
01:35:53,280 --> 01:35:58,159
early. Uh Eric Antinau who I've

2727
01:35:56,239 --> 01:36:00,239
mentioned previously told me that it was

2728
01:35:58,159 --> 01:36:02,320
very strange that you left Google to

2729
01:36:00,239 --> 01:36:04,560
join Facebook at that stage. Google was

2730
01:36:02,320 --> 01:36:07,440
killing it on top of the world. You had

2731
01:36:04,560 --> 01:36:09,199
such a strong career path. Things were

2732
01:36:07,440 --> 01:36:12,719
going great but you decided to take a

2733
01:36:09,199 --> 01:36:14,320
big leap joining Facebook. What made

2734
01:36:12,719 --> 01:36:15,440
what did you see? Because I think

2735
01:36:14,320 --> 01:36:17,360
there's something interesting here that

2736
01:36:15,440 --> 01:36:19,120
we can learn about what you saw that

2737
01:36:17,360 --> 01:36:21,120
helps that may help other people decide

2738
01:36:19,120 --> 01:36:25,199
where to go work.

2739
01:36:21,120 --> 01:36:28,320
I've always been enamored with this idea

2740
01:36:25,199 --> 01:36:31,280
of understanding us as fundamentally

2741
01:36:28,320 --> 01:36:33,199
human and how we're wired.

2742
01:36:31,280 --> 01:36:36,080
And

2743
01:36:33,199 --> 01:36:37,520
I remember at the time, you know,

2744
01:36:36,080 --> 01:36:38,800
talking to the folks at Facebook and

2745
01:36:37,520 --> 01:36:40,080
seeing it and this is back when like

2746
01:36:38,800 --> 01:36:41,920
people like, "Oh, this is just a college

2747
01:36:40,080 --> 01:36:44,320
site, you know, and and that's that was

2748
01:36:41,920 --> 01:36:45,920
the the vibe back then." But what I saw

2749
01:36:44,320 --> 01:36:49,040
was

2750
01:36:45,920 --> 01:36:50,880
that the team and Mark and and others

2751
01:36:49,040 --> 01:36:54,239
really

2752
01:36:50,880 --> 01:36:57,119
understood the fundamental human sort of

2753
01:36:54,239 --> 01:37:00,080
desires that people had to connect and

2754
01:36:57,119 --> 01:37:02,400
feel lonely and to to share and they

2755
01:37:00,080 --> 01:37:03,840
really got the right articulation of the

2756
01:37:02,400 --> 01:37:06,080
problem they were trying to solve which

2757
01:37:03,840 --> 01:37:08,480
was to to to make the world more open

2758
01:37:06,080 --> 01:37:11,199
and connected. And this really resonated

2759
01:37:08,480 --> 01:37:13,040
with me because I again I studied a lot

2760
01:37:11,199 --> 01:37:14,400
in college like psychology and just I

2761
01:37:13,040 --> 01:37:16,560
was really enamored with this idea of

2762
01:37:14,400 --> 01:37:20,400
like how are we as humans fundamentally

2763
01:37:16,560 --> 01:37:22,239
wired and it felt to me like a a

2764
01:37:20,400 --> 01:37:25,760
no-brainer to go work at Facebook

2765
01:37:22,239 --> 01:37:27,840
because they saw

2766
01:37:25,760 --> 01:37:32,000
how people were wired and how to

2767
01:37:27,840 --> 01:37:33,920
actually build products that complement

2768
01:37:32,000 --> 01:37:36,239
how people are wired, right? And it

2769
01:37:33,920 --> 01:37:37,679
wasn't that they were trying to force

2770
01:37:36,239 --> 01:37:39,760
fit something into something that was

2771
01:37:37,679 --> 01:37:41,280
unnatural. It was almost like, you know,

2772
01:37:39,760 --> 01:37:43,920
how do we build technologies and and

2773
01:37:41,280 --> 01:37:45,679
products that actually um augment our

2774
01:37:43,920 --> 01:37:50,320
our fundamental desire to kind of stay

2775
01:37:45,679 --> 01:37:51,760
connected? And this goes back to sort of

2776
01:37:50,320 --> 01:37:53,360
why I think the power of wars is so

2777
01:37:51,760 --> 01:37:54,639
important is because, you know, you take

2778
01:37:53,360 --> 01:37:57,600
a look at some of the mission statements

2779
01:37:54,639 --> 01:37:59,040
for like Fster or or MySpace. I don't

2780
01:37:57,600 --> 01:38:00,719
even know if they had mission statements

2781
01:37:59,040 --> 01:38:02,639
or what they were. they were kind of

2782
01:38:00,719 --> 01:38:04,880
vapid and they didn't really speak to

2783
01:38:02,639 --> 01:38:07,600
the fundamental humanity of what

2784
01:38:04,880 --> 01:38:09,280
Facebook was striving to build and that

2785
01:38:07,600 --> 01:38:11,920
just deeply resonated with me, right?

2786
01:38:09,280 --> 01:38:13,199
And so it's I remember spending time

2787
01:38:11,920 --> 01:38:14,560
with Eric being like, "Hey, what should

2788
01:38:13,199 --> 01:38:16,639
I do? Should I take this offer from

2789
01:38:14,560 --> 01:38:18,560
Facebook or should I stay at Google?"

2790
01:38:16,639 --> 01:38:20,960
But ultimately it was just like that

2791
01:38:18,560 --> 01:38:22,159
deep resonance with my values of

2792
01:38:20,960 --> 01:38:24,320
building things that were fundamentally

2793
01:38:22,159 --> 01:38:26,000
human. And ultimately, I think that for

2794
01:38:24,320 --> 01:38:29,920
any startup out there, anyone building

2795
01:38:26,000 --> 01:38:32,400
product, the more that you can get a

2796
01:38:29,920 --> 01:38:34,880
good impedance match between what you're

2797
01:38:32,400 --> 01:38:36,880
building and what humans fundamentally

2798
01:38:34,880 --> 01:38:39,920
want and need, the more successful

2799
01:38:36,880 --> 01:38:42,320
you're going to be, right? Um, so that's

2800
01:38:39,920 --> 01:38:45,760
that's like my my my big answer. I think

2801
01:38:42,320 --> 01:38:47,920
the the second an secondary answer um

2802
01:38:45,760 --> 01:38:51,440
I've always

2803
01:38:47,920 --> 01:38:54,320
optimized for learning like in my career

2804
01:38:51,440 --> 01:38:56,320
and this is a huge thing that I say to a

2805
01:38:54,320 --> 01:38:57,600
lot of people because they look at sort

2806
01:38:56,320 --> 01:38:59,119
of like oh you've been at all these

2807
01:38:57,600 --> 01:39:02,400
companies like what's your secret? like,

2808
01:38:59,119 --> 01:39:04,159
well, I've just figured out that I want

2809
01:39:02,400 --> 01:39:05,840
to go to the place where I can learn the

2810
01:39:04,159 --> 01:39:08,960
most.

2811
01:39:05,840 --> 01:39:11,360
And for me, that wasn't really Google,

2812
01:39:08,960 --> 01:39:14,719
but I had so much I wanted to learn from

2813
01:39:11,360 --> 01:39:17,199
operating at Facebook. Um, and at

2814
01:39:14,719 --> 01:39:19,920
Facebook, I would say, yeah, I was there

2815
01:39:17,199 --> 01:39:22,000
for nine and a half years, but I always

2816
01:39:19,920 --> 01:39:23,520
jumped around every two and a half or so

2817
01:39:22,000 --> 01:39:26,480
when I feel like there was something new

2818
01:39:23,520 --> 01:39:28,080
to learn. And

2819
01:39:26,480 --> 01:39:29,679
that's it. That's I mean I don't know if

2820
01:39:28,080 --> 01:39:31,520
it's a secret or not. It just it just I

2821
01:39:29,679 --> 01:39:33,119
got lucky and I just was able to have

2822
01:39:31,520 --> 01:39:35,760
opportunities to learn different things

2823
01:39:33,119 --> 01:39:38,000
and different skills. Um and that served

2824
01:39:35,760 --> 01:39:39,840
me quite well and regardless of any

2825
01:39:38,000 --> 01:39:41,920
outcome I would say that's just a great

2826
01:39:39,840 --> 01:39:43,360
way to live your life. Um personally is

2827
01:39:41,920 --> 01:39:45,760
just to kind of optimize for learning

2828
01:39:43,360 --> 01:39:48,000
and those experiences and and for me you

2829
01:39:45,760 --> 01:39:50,159
know moving to Facebook was that I saw

2830
01:39:48,000 --> 01:39:52,239
so much learning that that that could

2831
01:39:50,159 --> 01:39:54,080
have happened and it ultimately did

2832
01:39:52,239 --> 01:39:56,719
happen. So I feel like that it was a

2833
01:39:54,080 --> 01:39:58,560
good outcome too. Boy did it.

2834
01:39:56,719 --> 01:39:59,920
So, a couple takeaways here for folks

2835
01:39:58,560 --> 01:40:01,840
that are maybe trying to decide between

2836
01:39:59,920 --> 01:40:05,280
a couple roles, maybe deciding if they

2837
01:40:01,840 --> 01:40:07,119
should leave and do something new. Is uh

2838
01:40:05,280 --> 01:40:08,719
one, are you feeling like you're

2839
01:40:07,119 --> 01:40:10,639
learning enough slash is the new place

2840
01:40:08,719 --> 01:40:13,040
you're thinking about going to help you

2841
01:40:10,639 --> 01:40:14,560
learn a lot more? too is this uh is what

2842
01:40:13,040 --> 01:40:16,960
they're building aligned with human

2843
01:40:14,560 --> 01:40:18,320
behavior almost this impotent impetence

2844
01:40:16,960 --> 01:40:20,639
match that you described feels like

2845
01:40:18,320 --> 01:40:22,239
there's another element you uh shared

2846
01:40:20,639 --> 01:40:26,239
which is do they have a really unique

2847
01:40:22,239 --> 01:40:28,239
insight about how things work and also

2848
01:40:26,239 --> 01:40:29,679
do you really care about this is this

2849
01:40:28,239 --> 01:40:30,719
also how you see the world so you're

2850
01:40:29,679 --> 01:40:32,000
talking about a Facebook like they had

2851
01:40:30,719 --> 01:40:33,520
this really unique insight about human

2852
01:40:32,000 --> 01:40:35,600
behavior and that was really important

2853
01:40:33,520 --> 01:40:37,360
to you and so it's a really good fit

2854
01:40:35,600 --> 01:40:38,719
100% yeah I think the insight thing

2855
01:40:37,360 --> 01:40:41,760
thank you for summarizing that and

2856
01:40:38,719 --> 01:40:43,280
drawing that out because that is um

2857
01:40:41,760 --> 01:40:44,480
that's also what I look for and when I

2858
01:40:43,280 --> 01:40:46,159
you know want to partner with companies

2859
01:40:44,480 --> 01:40:47,760
and startups now is like do you have

2860
01:40:46,159 --> 01:40:50,800
that unique insight? Are you teaching me

2861
01:40:47,760 --> 01:40:53,600
something that I I really don't know. Um

2862
01:40:50,800 --> 01:40:57,119
and that usually is a good indicator of

2863
01:40:53,600 --> 01:40:58,320
a strong point of view. Um and uh having

2864
01:40:57,119 --> 01:40:59,920
a strong point of view is really

2865
01:40:58,320 --> 01:41:01,600
important because like you know there's

2866
01:40:59,920 --> 01:41:04,800
a saying that Mike and Kevin had at at

2867
01:41:01,600 --> 01:41:07,119
Instagram which is um uh we may not be

2868
01:41:04,800 --> 01:41:08,800
right but at least we're not confused. I

2869
01:41:07,119 --> 01:41:10,239
think that just it was it's a beautiful

2870
01:41:08,800 --> 01:41:12,159
phrase I thought because like you know

2871
01:41:10,239 --> 01:41:15,520
sometimes you just got to go and do the

2872
01:41:12,159 --> 01:41:19,199
thing that you think is right. Um and

2873
01:41:15,520 --> 01:41:20,719
the indecision is going to be one of the

2874
01:41:19,199 --> 01:41:23,280
things that really kind of gets you and

2875
01:41:20,719 --> 01:41:25,679
bites you right. So that that that for

2876
01:41:23,280 --> 01:41:27,840
me is is something is I look for folks

2877
01:41:25,679 --> 01:41:30,080
who have a strong conviction uh whether

2878
01:41:27,840 --> 01:41:31,840
it's the the founders I support uh you

2879
01:41:30,080 --> 01:41:33,840
know when I go join and and be an

2880
01:41:31,840 --> 01:41:36,000
operator at the company or the founders

2881
01:41:33,840 --> 01:41:38,320
I support in my current role. That's so

2882
01:41:36,000 --> 01:41:40,400
interesting. Tor Cohen, the CPO of

2883
01:41:38,320 --> 01:41:42,159
LinkedIn, uses that's that's a famous

2884
01:41:40,400 --> 01:41:43,119
phrase that he often uses, too. So, I

2885
01:41:42,159 --> 01:41:45,119
wonder if you borrowed it from those

2886
01:41:43,119 --> 01:41:47,360
guys. Yeah, that was that was one of his

2887
01:41:45,119 --> 01:41:49,679
mottos. Uh, we may not be right, but

2888
01:41:47,360 --> 01:41:51,520
we're not confused. Wow. I didn't know

2889
01:41:49,679 --> 01:41:52,719
that. So, I I did talk to him at one

2890
01:41:51,520 --> 01:41:54,560
point. I don't remember if that's

2891
01:41:52,719 --> 01:41:55,679
something we talked about, but again, it

2892
01:41:54,560 --> 01:41:57,199
could just be like, you know, great

2893
01:41:55,679 --> 01:41:59,520
minds think alike, and we just had

2894
01:41:57,199 --> 01:42:01,679
different uh different great folks from

2895
01:41:59,520 --> 01:42:03,199
Mike and Kevin and and Tor feeling

2896
01:42:01,679 --> 01:42:04,880
feeling the same vibes. I love just how

2897
01:42:03,199 --> 01:42:06,719
many episodes this conversation has

2898
01:42:04,880 --> 01:42:08,159
referenced. Okay, so speaking of

2899
01:42:06,719 --> 01:42:09,600
learning, final question before we get

2900
01:42:08,159 --> 01:42:11,760
to our very exciting lightning round.

2901
01:42:09,600 --> 01:42:14,320
I'm going to take us to fail corner,

2902
01:42:11,760 --> 01:42:16,960
right? Which very aligned with uh your

2903
01:42:14,320 --> 01:42:19,199
growth mindset question. So the idea of

2904
01:42:16,960 --> 01:42:20,560
this segment is people come on this

2905
01:42:19,199 --> 01:42:22,320
podcast, they share all these amazing

2906
01:42:20,560 --> 01:42:24,320
stories of everything's working out. I

2907
01:42:22,320 --> 01:42:26,719
had so much success, worked at all these

2908
01:42:24,320 --> 01:42:28,800
incredible companies, everything worked.

2909
01:42:26,719 --> 01:42:30,560
But in reality, things don't often work

2910
01:42:28,800 --> 01:42:33,920
out. Most people go through a lot of

2911
01:42:30,560 --> 01:42:36,480
failed uh initiatives, projects, career

2912
01:42:33,920 --> 01:42:39,360
uh hits. So the question is just what's

2913
01:42:36,480 --> 01:42:42,400
a product that you built and launch that

2914
01:42:39,360 --> 01:42:44,000
was just a big failure? And I'll ask it

2915
01:42:42,400 --> 01:42:46,960
the way you ask it. What's how did that

2916
01:42:44,000 --> 01:42:48,719
change the way you think and operate?

2917
01:42:46,960 --> 01:42:49,840
You know, one one example is, you know,

2918
01:42:48,719 --> 01:42:52,880
since we're talking about Instagram

2919
01:42:49,840 --> 01:42:55,440
before, um you know, we tried to build a

2920
01:42:52,880 --> 01:42:58,719
kind of camera first app at Instagram.

2921
01:42:55,440 --> 01:43:01,760
It was called Bolt and it didn't work.

2922
01:42:58,719 --> 01:43:04,239
and the

2923
01:43:01,760 --> 01:43:06,480
great, you know, kind of levels of craft

2924
01:43:04,239 --> 01:43:07,600
and design and and the premise was

2925
01:43:06,480 --> 01:43:09,440
essentially like, you know, can we make

2926
01:43:07,600 --> 01:43:11,440
it so it's just reduces the pressure to

2927
01:43:09,440 --> 01:43:12,719
share, right? And you can open to a

2928
01:43:11,440 --> 01:43:14,800
camera, you can you can just kind of

2929
01:43:12,719 --> 01:43:16,400
like send some things to folks and you

2930
01:43:14,800 --> 01:43:20,719
get some good feedback and you kind of

2931
01:43:16,400 --> 01:43:22,560
uh go from there. And uh it was and

2932
01:43:20,719 --> 01:43:23,920
obviously the Instagram design team, so

2933
01:43:22,560 --> 01:43:25,679
it was top-notch like the app was

2934
01:43:23,920 --> 01:43:27,199
designed really well. It was really fast

2935
01:43:25,679 --> 01:43:28,480
because it was Instagram, you know,

2936
01:43:27,199 --> 01:43:29,920
engineering team and they were just

2937
01:43:28,480 --> 01:43:31,840
really good at making performant mobile

2938
01:43:29,920 --> 01:43:34,159
apps, right? It had all of the

2939
01:43:31,840 --> 01:43:36,960
advantages that we had talked about uh

2940
01:43:34,159 --> 01:43:38,800
that we valued at Instagram, but we

2941
01:43:36,960 --> 01:43:43,199
launched it and I believe it was New

2942
01:43:38,800 --> 01:43:45,840
Zealand or Australia and it didn't work.

2943
01:43:43,199 --> 01:43:47,440
Um, and I remember the the reason we we

2944
01:43:45,840 --> 01:43:49,679
we knew this is we're looking at sort of

2945
01:43:47,440 --> 01:43:52,560
the the retention graphs and retention

2946
01:43:49,679 --> 01:43:54,400
is the key indicator in any product that

2947
01:43:52,560 --> 01:43:55,840
you build. uh it's not the number of

2948
01:43:54,400 --> 01:43:57,280
users, it's not the volume, it's

2949
01:43:55,840 --> 01:43:59,280
actually retention and cohorted

2950
01:43:57,280 --> 01:44:01,600
retention. You can you can draw the you

2951
01:43:59,280 --> 01:44:04,159
plot the line and and if it asmmptotes

2952
01:44:01,600 --> 01:44:06,800
then you're in a good spot um because

2953
01:44:04,159 --> 01:44:09,199
that means that people over uh x period

2954
01:44:06,800 --> 01:44:12,080
of time will continue to stay on the app

2955
01:44:09,199 --> 01:44:13,840
and that just didn't happen. And I think

2956
01:44:12,080 --> 01:44:16,960
the learning here was that you can

2957
01:44:13,840 --> 01:44:20,000
really have the best team in the world

2958
01:44:16,960 --> 01:44:21,760
with the best product taste. Um, and you

2959
01:44:20,000 --> 01:44:24,400
can't really predict what's going to hit

2960
01:44:21,760 --> 01:44:26,320
on the first go.

2961
01:44:24,400 --> 01:44:28,400
And failure is okay. You're just going

2962
01:44:26,320 --> 01:44:30,159
to up and learn from that, right? And

2963
01:44:28,400 --> 01:44:31,520
nobody wallowed over that. We actually

2964
01:44:30,159 --> 01:44:33,199
had some technology that we built there

2965
01:44:31,520 --> 01:44:34,880
that we were able to port over to the

2966
01:44:33,199 --> 01:44:38,159
main app which was really really

2967
01:44:34,880 --> 01:44:41,520
helpful. But, you know, to quote the

2968
01:44:38,159 --> 01:44:43,679
great American poet Sean Carter, it

2969
01:44:41,520 --> 01:44:47,600
ain't a loss, it's a lesson, right? And

2970
01:44:43,679 --> 01:44:50,400
I think it's really important that you

2971
01:44:47,600 --> 01:44:52,080
see that as a product person is that you

2972
01:44:50,400 --> 01:44:54,560
don't you don't see it as failure. You

2973
01:44:52,080 --> 01:44:57,199
see it as like kind of great now I now

2974
01:44:54,560 --> 01:44:59,600
I'm that much smarter, right? Um and

2975
01:44:57,199 --> 01:45:01,360
this is something that I've just

2976
01:44:59,600 --> 01:45:03,920
collected. There's other examples as

2977
01:45:01,360 --> 01:45:05,920
well. Um but I think this is one of a

2978
01:45:03,920 --> 01:45:07,840
good example of sort of uh something

2979
01:45:05,920 --> 01:45:09,360
that's somewhat counterintuitive that

2980
01:45:07,840 --> 01:45:11,679
you have the best team. you're going to

2981
01:45:09,360 --> 01:45:13,600
provide those hits over and over, but

2982
01:45:11,679 --> 01:45:15,199
sometimes you you can't predict those

2983
01:45:13,600 --> 01:45:16,719
hits. And you just have to have the

2984
01:45:15,199 --> 01:45:18,880
wisdom to be like, "Okay, let's let's

2985
01:45:16,719 --> 01:45:19,920
let's uh see what we can learn here, see

2986
01:45:18,880 --> 01:45:22,239
what we can save here, and then move

2987
01:45:19,920 --> 01:45:24,880
on." I absolutely remember that product

2988
01:45:22,239 --> 01:45:26,800
and launch or heard about it. And uh but

2989
01:45:24,880 --> 01:45:28,320
I also don't ever think about it. And so

2990
01:45:26,800 --> 01:45:30,719
I think it's a good reminder because

2991
01:45:28,320 --> 01:45:32,639
that's a you know, Instagram launching a

2992
01:45:30,719 --> 01:45:34,880
new product that's trying to rethink the

2993
01:45:32,639 --> 01:45:36,719
way you do social your camera. That's a

2994
01:45:34,880 --> 01:45:38,800
big deal. And so I could see that being

2995
01:45:36,719 --> 01:45:40,800
a really big deal for it not to work

2996
01:45:38,800 --> 01:45:44,080
out. At the same time, nobody remembers

2997
01:45:40,800 --> 01:45:45,520
that really. Exactly. Yeah. Peter, we've

2998
01:45:44,080 --> 01:45:46,880
we've gone for two hours at this point.

2999
01:45:45,520 --> 01:45:48,800
I feel like we could do it two hours

3000
01:45:46,880 --> 01:45:50,880
more. Uh we'll save that for another

3001
01:45:48,800 --> 01:45:52,560
conversation. Great. Before we get to

3002
01:45:50,880 --> 01:45:54,880
our very exciting lightning round, is

3003
01:45:52,560 --> 01:45:58,000
there anything else you either wanted to

3004
01:45:54,880 --> 01:45:59,520
share or want to leave listeners with to

3005
01:45:58,000 --> 01:46:00,880
maybe double down on a point you made

3006
01:45:59,520 --> 01:46:03,360
that you think might be helpful?

3007
01:46:00,880 --> 01:46:04,719
Otherwise, we'll just jump right in. I

3008
01:46:03,360 --> 01:46:07,119
think we should jump right in because I

3009
01:46:04,719 --> 01:46:10,400
I I feel like you've uh you've extracted

3010
01:46:07,119 --> 01:46:12,239
every little ounce of what wisdom I had

3011
01:46:10,400 --> 01:46:13,920
here. Um and you did a great job here

3012
01:46:12,239 --> 01:46:16,239
just helping me uh remember these

3013
01:46:13,920 --> 01:46:18,080
stories and uh recounting stuff. So I'm

3014
01:46:16,239 --> 01:46:20,000
I'm ready to jump in. That's my goal. Uh

3015
01:46:18,080 --> 01:46:22,639
although I know there uh is much more

3016
01:46:20,000 --> 01:46:24,480
that I haven't even started to tap. Uh

3017
01:46:22,639 --> 01:46:26,960
but with that we reached our very

3018
01:46:24,480 --> 01:46:29,040
exciting lightning round. Are you ready?

3019
01:46:26,960 --> 01:46:30,560
Uh I'm ready. Question one. What are two

3020
01:46:29,040 --> 01:46:32,480
or three books that you find yourself

3021
01:46:30,560 --> 01:46:34,400
recommending most to other people? This

3022
01:46:32,480 --> 01:46:36,719
is easy for me. Um, number one is

3023
01:46:34,400 --> 01:46:39,040
Sapiens. Um, you if you're a product

3024
01:46:36,719 --> 01:46:40,880
person, you have to understand uh our

3025
01:46:39,040 --> 01:46:42,639
own humanity if you want to build

3026
01:46:40,880 --> 01:46:44,880
products for people straight up. That's

3027
01:46:42,639 --> 01:46:46,480
that's that's a beautiful book. I read

3028
01:46:44,880 --> 01:46:48,880
it before it was called Sapiens. It was

3029
01:46:46,480 --> 01:46:50,239
called uh from animals to gods uh and it

3030
01:46:48,880 --> 01:46:52,080
was just republished a different name,

3031
01:46:50,239 --> 01:46:54,320
but it has really stuck with me and I

3032
01:46:52,080 --> 01:46:56,800
remember it's a very short easy read.

3033
01:46:54,320 --> 01:46:59,199
So, I I'd recommend that. Uh the second

3034
01:46:56,800 --> 01:47:00,719
book I think for product folks is is a

3035
01:46:59,199 --> 01:47:02,880
classic one which is the design of

3036
01:47:00,719 --> 01:47:05,520
everyday things by Don Norman. This may

3037
01:47:02,880 --> 01:47:07,679
seem outdated and old but it's I promise

3038
01:47:05,520 --> 01:47:09,760
you it's not. It really helps you

3039
01:47:07,679 --> 01:47:11,920
understand you know physical product

3040
01:47:09,760 --> 01:47:14,000
design which is again things that mold

3041
01:47:11,920 --> 01:47:16,560
and shape to humanity. I think it gives

3042
01:47:14,000 --> 01:47:17,760
you a good sense of that. Third book is

3043
01:47:16,560 --> 01:47:20,400
something I'm reading right now. It's

3044
01:47:17,760 --> 01:47:21,920
recommended by a a friend of mine and I

3045
01:47:20,400 --> 01:47:26,000
can't put it down. It's called The Silk

3046
01:47:21,920 --> 01:47:28,159
Roads um uh by Peter Franco and

3047
01:47:26,000 --> 01:47:31,280
basically this is a recounting of

3048
01:47:28,159 --> 01:47:33,199
history through the lens of the Silk

3049
01:47:31,280 --> 01:47:35,600
Road and and sort and the Middle East

3050
01:47:33,199 --> 01:47:37,679
and how how that's evolved. It's so

3051
01:47:35,600 --> 01:47:39,520
fascinating because one of the things I

3052
01:47:37,679 --> 01:47:40,800
love, Lenny, is seeing things from

3053
01:47:39,520 --> 01:47:42,320
different perspectives. This is why

3054
01:47:40,800 --> 01:47:45,040
travel's fun. This is why like, you

3055
01:47:42,320 --> 01:47:46,960
know, user research is fun for me. And

3056
01:47:45,040 --> 01:47:48,880
it really helps you see the events of

3057
01:47:46,960 --> 01:47:51,760
world history that we've all been

3058
01:47:48,880 --> 01:47:53,920
experiencing through a very western view

3059
01:47:51,760 --> 01:47:55,600
uh viewpoint in a in a different way.

3060
01:47:53,920 --> 01:47:56,800
And it kind of connects a bunch of

3061
01:47:55,600 --> 01:47:57,840
things that are like, you know, there's

3062
01:47:56,800 --> 01:47:59,520
western thought, there's eastern

3063
01:47:57,840 --> 01:48:01,520
thought, but if you see the connection

3064
01:47:59,520 --> 01:48:03,360
between them, it's super fascinating.

3065
01:48:01,520 --> 01:48:05,360
I'm only two chap three or maybe four

3066
01:48:03,360 --> 01:48:07,840
chapters in, but definitely something I

3067
01:48:05,360 --> 01:48:09,840
would recommend off the bat. What is a

3068
01:48:07,840 --> 01:48:11,760
favorite recent movie or TV show that

3069
01:48:09,840 --> 01:48:13,760
you've really enjoyed? I have to go.

3070
01:48:11,760 --> 01:48:15,280
Maybe it's not as recent, but I the one

3071
01:48:13,760 --> 01:48:17,920
that always comes back to me is The

3072
01:48:15,280 --> 01:48:19,600
Wire. Uh HBO's The Wire. And And I just

3073
01:48:17,920 --> 01:48:21,760
I guess there's just so many TV shows

3074
01:48:19,600 --> 01:48:23,679
now that are I'm still processing, do I

3075
01:48:21,760 --> 01:48:25,920
want to put it in my all-time great, but

3076
01:48:23,679 --> 01:48:28,080
the storytelling there and the v the

3077
01:48:25,920 --> 01:48:29,920
various different sort of consistent

3078
01:48:28,080 --> 01:48:31,760
characters, but the fact that there's

3079
01:48:29,920 --> 01:48:33,440
the beautiful writing of The Wire is

3080
01:48:31,760 --> 01:48:34,639
something that's unparalleled. I'm now

3081
01:48:33,440 --> 01:48:35,600
curious what's in your all-time great

3082
01:48:34,639 --> 01:48:37,600
list, but I'm not going to go there.

3083
01:48:35,600 --> 01:48:38,480
We're going to keep going. Uh what's a

3084
01:48:37,600 --> 01:48:40,400
favorite product you've recently

3085
01:48:38,480 --> 01:48:42,320
discovered that you really love?

3086
01:48:40,400 --> 01:48:44,159
Um, I I I'm just going to go with

3087
01:48:42,320 --> 01:48:45,920
Cornola because I think that we talked

3088
01:48:44,159 --> 01:48:49,040
about this before, but this has been a

3089
01:48:45,920 --> 01:48:51,199
superpower for me and I have a lot of

3090
01:48:49,040 --> 01:48:53,840
commute time now. What I do is I just do

3091
01:48:51,199 --> 01:48:55,920
a single player mode. I go up and I I

3092
01:48:53,840 --> 01:48:58,159
start thinking about and brainstorming

3093
01:48:55,920 --> 01:49:01,040
about sort of ideas or thesis I have for

3094
01:48:58,159 --> 01:49:03,679
investing or whatnot and I get to where

3095
01:49:01,040 --> 01:49:06,159
I'm going and boom, it's there organized

3096
01:49:03,679 --> 01:49:07,440
in a more cogent way and oftentimes ways

3097
01:49:06,159 --> 01:49:09,440
that I didn't even think about

3098
01:49:07,440 --> 01:49:11,600
articulating them. So, it it goes

3099
01:49:09,440 --> 01:49:13,520
through the process of of forming words,

3100
01:49:11,600 --> 01:49:16,400
but it also helps that assistance and I

3101
01:49:13,520 --> 01:49:18,159
think it's a beautiful product um on

3102
01:49:16,400 --> 01:49:20,080
many different levels. Wow, Granola's

3103
01:49:18,159 --> 01:49:21,679
killing it at this category recently.

3104
01:49:20,080 --> 01:49:23,600
And I'll give a shout out. You get a

3105
01:49:21,679 --> 01:49:25,280
year free of Granola if you become

3106
01:49:23,600 --> 01:49:27,280

entire team. They're just they gave an

3109
01:49:29,280 --> 01:49:33,040
incredible deal. Is that true? I didn't

3110
01:49:31,040 --> 01:49:34,480
know that. 100% true. Okay. Well, I tell

3111
01:49:33,040 --> 01:49:35,600
you, I was not compensated for that

3112
01:49:34,480 --> 01:49:37,119
little pitch there. That was that's

3113
01:49:35,600 --> 01:49:38,159
that's genuine right there. I'm also not

3114
01:49:37,119 --> 01:49:39,760
compensated. Yeah, if you go to

3115
01:49:38,159 --> 01:49:41,760

3116
01:49:39,760 --> 01:49:43,119
you'll see a way to get it. Uh, love the

3117
01:49:41,760 --> 01:49:44,400
product, use it all the time. I should

3118
01:49:43,119 --> 01:49:46,000
be using it for these interviews and

3119
01:49:44,400 --> 01:49:48,320
then I could have a whole summary ready

3120
01:49:46,000 --> 01:49:49,920
to go. Uh, okay. Next question. Do you

3121
01:49:48,320 --> 01:49:53,199
have a favorite life motto that you

3122
01:49:49,920 --> 01:49:55,360
often come back to in work or in life?

3123
01:49:53,199 --> 01:49:57,280
Yes. This actually something that my dad

3124
01:49:55,360 --> 01:49:59,280
taught me. Uh, it's it's a it's a saying

3125
01:49:57,280 --> 01:50:01,280
that is in Chinese that it actually

3126
01:49:59,280 --> 01:50:04,960
rhymes in Chinese, but you know, kind of

3127
01:50:01,280 --> 01:50:06,159
almost rhymes in in English. And it's uh

3128
01:50:04,960 --> 01:50:09,760
it goes something like this in English,

3129
01:50:06,159 --> 01:50:12,480
which is if you move a tree, it dies.

3130
01:50:09,760 --> 01:50:14,159
But if you move a person, he thrives.

3131
01:50:12,480 --> 01:50:15,920
And I think it's a really interesting

3132
01:50:14,159 --> 01:50:18,159
thing I keep on coming back to. And this

3133
01:50:15,920 --> 01:50:19,760
goes back to why, you know, for me, it's

3134
01:50:18,159 --> 01:50:21,119
just the the joy of learning and trying

3135
01:50:19,760 --> 01:50:22,320
new experiences and trying, you know,

3136
01:50:21,119 --> 01:50:24,320
being at different companies that I've

3137
01:50:22,320 --> 01:50:25,679
been very fortunate to be at. I really

3138
01:50:24,320 --> 01:50:27,440
think that that's how you should live

3139
01:50:25,679 --> 01:50:29,440
life is just to kind of experience these

3140
01:50:27,440 --> 01:50:30,960
different experiences. And it's kind of

3141
01:50:29,440 --> 01:50:32,639
poetic to be like, yeah, like something

3142
01:50:30,960 --> 01:50:34,080
as you know, unfortunately for trees,

3143
01:50:32,639 --> 01:50:36,000
like you can't really move them after a

3144
01:50:34,080 --> 01:50:37,840
while. But for humans, I think that you

3145
01:50:36,000 --> 01:50:39,520
move them around and, you know, we get

3146
01:50:37,840 --> 01:50:41,760
different travel experiences and we get

3147
01:50:39,520 --> 01:50:43,199
different life experiences when we go to

3148
01:50:41,760 --> 01:50:46,000
different jobs. And I think that's

3149
01:50:43,199 --> 01:50:47,840
that's makes life really worth living.

3150
01:50:46,000 --> 01:50:49,040
There's a I always think about what I

3151
01:50:47,840 --> 01:50:51,280
would answer to this question, and

3152
01:50:49,040 --> 01:50:53,280
there's a few, but one is uh something I

3153
01:50:51,280 --> 01:50:55,040
always come back to when my wife and I

3154
01:50:53,280 --> 01:50:58,040
are deciding to do something is choose

3155
01:50:55,040 --> 01:50:58,040
adventure.

3156
01:50:59,040 --> 01:51:05,040
similar sentiment. Final question. Okay.

3157
01:51:02,080 --> 01:51:06,800
So, you've now be you moved from product

3158
01:51:05,040 --> 01:51:08,080
leader to investor. So, I just want to

3159
01:51:06,800 --> 01:51:09,280
give you a chance to share tell people

3160
01:51:08,080 --> 01:51:11,440
what kind of stuff you're looking for.

3161
01:51:09,280 --> 01:51:13,920
So, you moved you're felicus now

3162
01:51:11,440 --> 01:51:15,679
investing in startups. Yep. What sort of

3163
01:51:13,920 --> 01:51:17,280
startups are you looking for who should

3164
01:51:15,679 --> 01:51:19,119
reach out if they're interested in Well,

3165
01:51:17,280 --> 01:51:21,440
I I I appreciate that uh opportunity.

3166
01:51:19,119 --> 01:51:23,280
Look, for me, um I just I think it's

3167
01:51:21,440 --> 01:51:26,880
been very clear like I just love working

3168
01:51:23,280 --> 01:51:29,199
with great people. Um, and uh, you know,

3169
01:51:26,880 --> 01:51:31,280
it's it's for me investing is just the

3170
01:51:29,199 --> 01:51:33,119
ability to support uh, more amazing

3171
01:51:31,280 --> 01:51:35,119
founders. I've always been drawn to the

3172
01:51:33,119 --> 01:51:37,360
founder archetype, right? Like working

3173
01:51:35,119 --> 01:51:41,440
closely with Zuck or you know with

3174
01:51:37,360 --> 01:51:43,840
Travis or Howie um, Brendan at Oculus

3175
01:51:41,440 --> 01:51:45,199
and uh, you know, folks at OpenAI. I

3176
01:51:43,840 --> 01:51:48,159
think there's this amazing sort of

3177
01:51:45,199 --> 01:51:49,599
visionary person that I just I love

3178
01:51:48,159 --> 01:51:52,159
supporting in one way or another. and

3179
01:51:49,599 --> 01:51:54,800
I've supported them from uh mainly from

3180
01:51:52,159 --> 01:51:56,560
the inside as a product leader but uh

3181
01:51:54,800 --> 01:51:59,520
for me it's just finding those amazing

3182
01:51:56,560 --> 01:52:01,040
founders and in this current role I get

3183
01:51:59,520 --> 01:52:03,520
to work with many founders at the same

3184
01:52:01,040 --> 01:52:06,400
time right and and just two days ago I

3185
01:52:03,520 --> 01:52:07,840
was on had meaningful calls product jams

3186
01:52:06,400 --> 01:52:09,679
with like three different founders in

3187
01:52:07,840 --> 01:52:12,400
three different industries and that kind

3188
01:52:09,679 --> 01:52:13,920
of keeps my mind super alive so you know

3189
01:52:12,400 --> 01:52:16,000
that's that's kind of why I'm doing what

3190
01:52:13,920 --> 01:52:18,000
I'm doing now and and I I I would love

3191
01:52:16,000 --> 01:52:19,520
to find some more of those those amazing

3192
01:52:18,000 --> 01:52:22,080
thought partners and people that I can

3193
01:52:19,520 --> 01:52:25,040
just help out if I can. Okay. Then, uh,

3194
01:52:22,080 --> 01:52:26,880
stage and, uh, market, anything there

3195
01:52:25,040 --> 01:52:29,840
for folks of like, okay, he's a fit, not

3196
01:52:26,880 --> 01:52:32,960
a fit. Absolutely. So, I would say, um,

3197
01:52:29,840 --> 01:52:34,719
early stage, uh, seed, seed plus, and a,

3198
01:52:32,960 --> 01:52:37,679
uh, is where I really get excited. I

3199
01:52:34,719 --> 01:52:39,040
feel like I I'm able to help folks see

3200
01:52:37,679 --> 01:52:40,719
the next stage. I've seen a lot of

3201
01:52:39,040 --> 01:52:41,920
movies in my life, in my career, so it's

3202
01:52:40,719 --> 01:52:43,360
like, oh, great. I can definitely see

3203
01:52:41,920 --> 01:52:45,040
this extrapolating out. You don't have

3204
01:52:43,360 --> 01:52:46,480
to convince me of the future. And then

3205
01:52:45,040 --> 01:52:48,800
it's really fun to be able to jam and

3206
01:52:46,480 --> 01:52:51,119
and and help support if I can and how

3207
01:52:48,800 --> 01:52:53,520
you scale from the uh the one to 10 and

3208
01:52:51,119 --> 01:52:55,360
10 to 100. So that's that's really big.

3209
01:52:53,520 --> 01:52:56,639
Uh and in terms of what I look for, it's

3210
01:52:55,360 --> 01:52:57,920
the two things I said before. It's like

3211
01:52:56,639 --> 01:53:00,639
in this day and age, there's so many

3212
01:52:57,920 --> 01:53:02,400
amazing things going to be built. One is

3213
01:53:00,639 --> 01:53:06,080
do you have unique data and do you have

3214
01:53:02,400 --> 01:53:07,679
a data flywheel? Two, uh do you have a

3215
01:53:06,080 --> 01:53:09,599
really crafted workflow that you can

3216
01:53:07,679 --> 01:53:11,760
really get after? And I guess third,

3217
01:53:09,599 --> 01:53:14,080
it's it's like do you have that insight

3218
01:53:11,760 --> 01:53:16,159
of what product things actually matter?

3219
01:53:14,080 --> 01:53:18,400
and also which ones don't and then how

3220
01:53:16,159 --> 01:53:20,239
do you actually go and expand upon that.

3221
01:53:18,400 --> 01:53:21,920
So yeah, really excited to meet a bunch

3222
01:53:20,239 --> 01:53:23,599
more founders whether it comes from here

3223
01:53:21,920 --> 01:53:24,880
or somewhere else. Okay, so final

3224
01:53:23,599 --> 01:53:26,000
question then is how do folks reach out

3225
01:53:24,880 --> 01:53:27,760
if they want to actually talk to you

3226
01:53:26,000 --> 01:53:29,199
about this and how can listeners be

3227
01:53:27,760 --> 01:53:31,199
useful to you? Thank you for the

3228
01:53:29,199 --> 01:53:33,280
question. I am an introvert so I I'm

3229
01:53:31,199 --> 01:53:36,719
really kind of silent on a lot of social

3230
01:53:33,280 --> 01:53:38,960
media. I have accounts on on on on X and

3231
01:53:36,719 --> 01:53:40,800
you know threads but uh really I think

3232
01:53:38,960 --> 01:53:42,639
LinkedIn is the the the network of

3233
01:53:40,800 --> 01:53:44,320
choice for me. is just like I I really

3234
01:53:42,639 --> 01:53:46,480
uh I want to be able to passively kind

3235
01:53:44,320 --> 01:53:48,480
of consume and learn about what what's

3236
01:53:46,480 --> 01:53:50,480
what's happening, how you listeners can

3237
01:53:48,480 --> 01:53:51,920
be helpful. I just want to learn like

3238
01:53:50,480 --> 01:53:52,880
what what what's what are you all

3239
01:53:51,920 --> 01:53:54,639
thinking about? What are some of the

3240
01:53:52,880 --> 01:53:56,480
insights you're you're seeing? One of

3241
01:53:54,639 --> 01:53:58,560
the analogies I have about AI in this

3242
01:53:56,480 --> 01:54:00,480
day and age is that it's this really

3243
01:53:58,560 --> 01:54:03,199
interesting new element that humanity

3244
01:54:00,480 --> 01:54:06,000
has discovered. And what's awesome is

3245
01:54:03,199 --> 01:54:08,080
that humanity is also very creative. And

3246
01:54:06,000 --> 01:54:10,639
so what humanity does with this new

3247
01:54:08,080 --> 01:54:12,800
element I'm fascinated by, right? And

3248
01:54:10,639 --> 01:54:14,719
you can tell the founders who've

3249
01:54:12,800 --> 01:54:17,920
actually played with this element

3250
01:54:14,719 --> 01:54:20,080
because they have this innate sense of

3251
01:54:17,920 --> 01:54:21,840
what this thing can do and can't do. And

3252
01:54:20,080 --> 01:54:24,560
I I'm just looking to be inspired by the

3253
01:54:21,840 --> 01:54:26,000
creativity of of all y'all out there.

3254
01:54:24,560 --> 01:54:27,360
Wow, that's such a cool way of thinking

3255
01:54:26,000 --> 01:54:30,080
about it. It's going to change my

3256
01:54:27,360 --> 01:54:31,760
perspective on AI a little bit. Peter,

3257
01:54:30,080 --> 01:54:34,239
this was incredible. I really appreciate

3258
01:54:31,760 --> 01:54:35,360
you taking the time to share so much

3259
01:54:34,239 --> 01:54:37,760
wisdom. I know this is the first time

3260
01:54:35,360 --> 01:54:39,199
you've done anything like this. Uh, I

3261
01:54:37,760 --> 01:54:40,719
feel like this is going to help a lot of

3262
01:54:39,199 --> 01:54:43,040
people in a lot of different ways. Feel

3263
01:54:40,719 --> 01:54:45,920
like we covered everything I wanted to

3264
01:54:43,040 --> 01:54:47,199
cover. So, just again, thank you for

3265
01:54:45,920 --> 01:54:49,280
Well, thank you for having me. This has

3266
01:54:47,199 --> 01:54:50,719
been a real pleasure and it's hopefully,

3267
01:54:49,280 --> 01:54:52,159
you know, some folks out there can get

3268
01:54:50,719 --> 01:54:54,159
some some learnings from this and find

3269
01:54:52,159 --> 01:54:55,760
it useful. But that's that was my goal

3270
01:54:54,159 --> 01:54:58,000
is to be able to share some things and

3271
01:54:55,760 --> 01:54:59,520
hopefully it will be helpful to some uh

3272
01:54:58,000 --> 01:55:01,040
folks out there. So, thank you. Thank

3273
01:54:59,520 --> 01:55:04,080
you for the opportunity. Thank you,

3274
01:55:01,040 --> 01:55:05,760
