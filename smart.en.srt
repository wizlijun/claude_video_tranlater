1
00:00:00,080 --> 00:00:06,960
If you think we only think with our

2
00:00:02,080 --> 00:00:09,679
brains, you tend to see AI as a

3
00:00:06,960 --> 00:00:14,320
replacement of our thinking process. We

4
00:00:09,679 --> 00:00:17,199
use AI to think for us instead.

5
00:00:14,320 --> 00:00:21,119
And that's obviously a risk. And if you

6
00:00:17,199 --> 00:00:23,840
think like that, you do that. You stop

7
00:00:21,119 --> 00:00:25,199
thinking for yourself. You let AI do the

8
00:00:23,840 --> 00:00:27,039
work.

9
00:00:25,199 --> 00:00:29,359
Mind Hack is a podcast about the

10
00:00:27,039 --> 00:00:31,920
psychology behind performance, behavior

11
00:00:29,359 --> 00:00:33,520
change, and self-optimization.

12
00:00:31,920 --> 00:00:35,440
Each episode explores how to think

13
00:00:33,520 --> 00:00:36,960
clearly, work smarter, and live

14
00:00:35,440 --> 00:00:38,480
intentionally through insightful

15
00:00:36,960 --> 00:00:40,879
conversations with leading

16
00:00:38,480 --> 00:00:44,520
entrepreneurs, scientists, and experts

17
00:00:40,879 --> 00:00:44,520
in human behavior.

18
00:00:46,399 --> 00:00:50,719
Hello and welcome to the Mind Hack

19
00:00:48,239 --> 00:00:52,879
Podcast, the show where we explore the

20
00:00:50,719 --> 00:00:55,840
science of peak performance, mindset,

21
00:00:52,879 --> 00:00:58,800
and personal growth. I'm your host Cody

22
00:00:55,840 --> 00:01:01,120
Mlan and today I'm joined by Dr. Sank

23
00:00:58,800 --> 00:01:03,680
Arn, a distinguished social social

24
00:01:01,120 --> 00:01:06,240
scientist, educator, and author of the

25
00:01:03,680 --> 00:01:08,880
groundbreaking bestseller, How to Take

26
00:01:06,240 --> 00:01:10,960
Smart Notes. His book, which introduced

27
00:01:08,880 --> 00:01:13,040
the powerful Zettocast method of

28
00:01:10,960 --> 00:01:15,600
personal knowledge management to over

29
00:01:13,040 --> 00:01:17,600
100,000 readers worldwide, has

30
00:01:15,600 --> 00:01:19,920
fundamentally challenged some of the

31
00:01:17,600 --> 00:01:23,439
traditional views on how we learn,

32
00:01:19,920 --> 00:01:25,600
think, and write. Dr. Rens argues that

33
00:01:23,439 --> 00:01:27,920
writing is not just a way to document

34
00:01:25,600 --> 00:01:30,720
our thoughts. It is the act of thinking

35
00:01:27,920 --> 00:01:33,520
itself. A concept that has profoundly

36
00:01:30,720 --> 00:01:36,320
reshaped my own approach to intellectual

37
00:01:33,520 --> 00:01:39,200
work. In this conversation will

38
00:01:36,320 --> 00:01:41,840
demystify the zetocasten approach often

39
00:01:39,200 --> 00:01:43,920
described as building a second brain and

40
00:01:41,840 --> 00:01:45,439
explore its practical power in

41
00:01:43,920 --> 00:01:47,360
overcoming common intellectual

42
00:01:45,439 --> 00:01:49,280
roadblocks like writer's block,

43
00:01:47,360 --> 00:01:52,159
procrastination, and information

44
00:01:49,280 --> 00:01:54,320
overload. We'll also discuss how Dr. RN

45
00:01:52,159 --> 00:01:56,560
sees modern tools like Obsidian and

46
00:01:54,320 --> 00:01:58,799
artificial intelligence fitting into the

47
00:01:56,560 --> 00:02:01,280
future of effective note-taking and

48
00:01:58,799 --> 00:02:03,280
learning. By the end of this episode,

49
00:02:01,280 --> 00:02:05,520
you'll walk away with clear, actionable

50
00:02:03,280 --> 00:02:07,360
insights and relatable strategies that

51
00:02:05,520 --> 00:02:08,879
you can apply immediately, whether

52
00:02:07,360 --> 00:02:10,720
you're looking to enhance academic

53
00:02:08,879 --> 00:02:13,440
performance, streamline your research

54
00:02:10,720 --> 00:02:16,239
process, or spark novel ideas for your

55
00:02:13,440 --> 00:02:18,720
next major creative project. So, without

56
00:02:16,239 --> 00:02:19,200
further ado, please welcome Dr. Shank

57
00:02:18,720 --> 00:02:20,640
Ar.

58
00:02:19,200 --> 00:02:23,120
>> Thank you, Cody, for having me.

59
00:02:20,640 --> 00:02:25,760
>> Dr. Arves, welcome to the show. So, your

60
00:02:23,120 --> 00:02:28,400
your book, How to Take Smart Notes, it's

61
00:02:25,760 --> 00:02:31,120
resonated with so many people around the

62
00:02:28,400 --> 00:02:33,599
world. You've sold over 100,000 copies.

63
00:02:31,120 --> 00:02:36,319
You've translated into eight languages.

64
00:02:33,599 --> 00:02:40,000
Did you ever expect your book on taking

65
00:02:36,319 --> 00:02:43,599
notes would become so widespread?

66
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:48,959
>> Um, I had two thoughts. one is hopefully

67
00:02:43,599 --> 00:02:52,959
I sell a few more than uh 10 copies and

68
00:02:48,959 --> 00:02:57,680
I have I had mainly my own students in

69
00:02:52,959 --> 00:03:02,640
mind because I couldn't find a really

70
00:02:57,680 --> 00:03:06,480
helpful book on writing and notetaking

71
00:03:02,640 --> 00:03:11,760
that mirrors the way I thought we

72
00:03:06,480 --> 00:03:14,720
developed a thesis. So there was just

73
00:03:11,760 --> 00:03:17,200
a need to write that because I didn't

74
00:03:14,720 --> 00:03:20,159
feel comfortable with the ones that were

75
00:03:17,200 --> 00:03:24,400
available. I did not expect at all that

76
00:03:20,159 --> 00:03:27,760
it resonated so much with people outside

77
00:03:24,400 --> 00:03:33,040
of academia. And

78
00:03:27,760 --> 00:03:37,040
um I'm very pleased how people took

79
00:03:33,040 --> 00:03:41,360
ideas and developed their own systems

80
00:03:37,040 --> 00:03:45,760
around it. So I see it less as an

81
00:03:41,360 --> 00:03:50,720
instruction and more as something that

82
00:03:45,760 --> 00:03:54,319
sparked a discussion. I'm really glad um

83
00:03:50,720 --> 00:03:56,159
happening. Yeah.

84
00:03:54,319 --> 00:03:57,920
>> And so for those who haven't read your

85
00:03:56,159 --> 00:04:01,360
book, can you give us kind of an

86
00:03:57,920 --> 00:04:03,519
immediate idea about what it's about and

87
00:04:01,360 --> 00:04:06,000
what kind of benefits that say new

88
00:04:03,519 --> 00:04:06,959
adopters could expect to to learn from

89
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:09,040
your method?

90
00:04:06,959 --> 00:04:11,519
>> Yeah, I mean there are multiple ways to

91
00:04:09,040 --> 00:04:17,759
describe what the tetra cousin is all

92
00:04:11,519 --> 00:04:20,160
about. Um, one way is it's um a system

93
00:04:17,759 --> 00:04:23,919
to write

94
00:04:20,160 --> 00:04:28,320
notes that connect in a way that you can

95
00:04:23,919 --> 00:04:31,680
build something out of them and where

96
00:04:28,320 --> 00:04:34,720
you have as you called it the second

97
00:04:31,680 --> 00:04:37,520
brain or an external brain you're in a

98
00:04:34,720 --> 00:04:39,919
dialogue with. Another way to describe

99
00:04:37,520 --> 00:04:44,880
it and that's how I did it in the book

100
00:04:39,919 --> 00:04:50,000
is um the author and social scientist

101
00:04:44,880 --> 00:04:54,479
Nicholas Luman I studied the most um

102
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:57,280
he's a system theory thinker um he was

103
00:04:54,479 --> 00:05:01,520
incredibly productive um writing almost

104
00:04:57,280 --> 00:05:03,280
60 books and less than 30 years hundreds

105
00:05:01,520 --> 00:05:05,280
of articles

106
00:05:03,280 --> 00:05:09,600
and

107
00:05:05,280 --> 00:05:13,039
um whenever he was was asked um how on

108
00:05:09,600 --> 00:05:15,600
earth he was able to be that productive

109
00:05:13,039 --> 00:05:18,320
um he referred to his subtle cousin. So

110
00:05:15,600 --> 00:05:21,199
obviously uh as someone who struggled a

111
00:05:18,320 --> 00:05:25,520
lot with writing I was intrigued uh what

112
00:05:21,199 --> 00:05:27,680
this system is all about and there is a

113
00:05:25,520 --> 00:05:30,880
research project still going on because

114
00:05:27,680 --> 00:05:35,600
it's such a vast amount of notes that

115
00:05:30,880 --> 00:05:38,639
needs to be digitalized and um

116
00:05:35,600 --> 00:05:40,880
put online. Um

117
00:05:38,639 --> 00:05:44,160
but there was very little available uh

118
00:05:40,880 --> 00:05:48,479
at that time. Um but there are others

119
00:05:44,160 --> 00:05:52,000
who work with similar methods and

120
00:05:48,479 --> 00:05:56,400
so I tried to understand

121
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:59,520
um how that really worked in a practical

122
00:05:56,400 --> 00:06:03,680
manner and

123
00:05:59,520 --> 00:06:05,360
that was fascinating to me and um so I

124
00:06:03,680 --> 00:06:07,280
wanted to write about that because there

125
00:06:05,360 --> 00:06:10,720
wasn't anything available that really

126
00:06:07,280 --> 00:06:15,280
described the method and because I at

127
00:06:10,720 --> 00:06:20,639
the same time taught a lot about

128
00:06:15,280 --> 00:06:24,960
um learning theories, I realized

129
00:06:20,639 --> 00:06:28,240
how much the settle casten put modern

130
00:06:24,960 --> 00:06:33,520
research into practice without lumen

131
00:06:28,240 --> 00:06:38,080
probably being aware of that. Um but

132
00:06:33,520 --> 00:06:40,160
and thirdly it resonates with um a new

133
00:06:38,080 --> 00:06:42,639
line of research

134
00:06:40,160 --> 00:06:45,120
that often

135
00:06:42,639 --> 00:06:48,000
goes under the label of external

136
00:06:45,120 --> 00:06:51,759
thinking. So the

137
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:53,360
realization how much of our environment

138
00:06:51,759 --> 00:06:57,840
contributes

139
00:06:53,360 --> 00:06:59,919
to our thinking processes and how much

140
00:06:57,840 --> 00:07:02,319
we can do

141
00:06:59,919 --> 00:07:05,520
to

142
00:07:02,319 --> 00:07:08,800
improve our thinking by thinking a

143
00:07:05,520 --> 00:07:11,440
little bit more systematically about how

144
00:07:08,800 --> 00:07:16,400
we design our environment in which we

145
00:07:11,440 --> 00:07:21,199
think. Um, so in a way it's all about

146
00:07:16,400 --> 00:07:23,360
a thinking environment design. And

147
00:07:21,199 --> 00:07:25,440
that might sound complicated, but in the

148
00:07:23,360 --> 00:07:30,160
end it's just

149
00:07:25,440 --> 00:07:32,639
writing on a daily or regular basis

150
00:07:30,160 --> 00:07:37,039
small pieces

151
00:07:32,639 --> 00:07:42,240
and add them to the existing

152
00:07:37,039 --> 00:07:45,599
pool of ideas you have. So you extend

153
00:07:42,240 --> 00:07:48,800
your thoughts instead of just collecting

154
00:07:45,599 --> 00:07:51,520
them. And that

155
00:07:48,800 --> 00:07:55,599
nudges you to

156
00:07:51,520 --> 00:07:57,919
develop more complex thoughts because

157
00:07:55,599 --> 00:08:00,080
having the thoughts externalized allows

158
00:07:57,919 --> 00:08:05,120
you to build up complexity which is

159
00:08:00,080 --> 00:08:09,360
impossible in our tiny brain. And it

160
00:08:05,120 --> 00:08:12,400
also constantly confronts you with

161
00:08:09,360 --> 00:08:16,720
things you have long forgotten.

162
00:08:12,400 --> 00:08:20,400
And that is like a builtin

163
00:08:16,720 --> 00:08:23,120
um critical element to your daily

164
00:08:20,400 --> 00:08:27,440
writing. Um where you're being reminded

165
00:08:23,120 --> 00:08:30,240
of things that might be um contradictory

166
00:08:27,440 --> 00:08:32,640
to your great idea you had in the

167
00:08:30,240 --> 00:08:36,800
morning. and instead of just putting it

168
00:08:32,640 --> 00:08:40,880
out um you contrast that with something

169
00:08:36,800 --> 00:08:43,440
you have already written down. And

170
00:08:40,880 --> 00:08:45,920
these are the moments usually where

171
00:08:43,440 --> 00:08:47,920
something interesting happens where you

172
00:08:45,920 --> 00:08:51,440
have contradicting ideas and have to

173
00:08:47,920 --> 00:08:56,480
figure out well um is one of them wrong

174
00:08:51,440 --> 00:08:59,920
or can I um combine them in in a way.

175
00:08:56,480 --> 00:09:04,080
Um, all these things only happen when

176
00:08:59,920 --> 00:09:05,839
you have a system in place where you

177
00:09:04,080 --> 00:09:09,279
have your thoughts in some way

178
00:09:05,839 --> 00:09:12,160
externalized. And usually we do that

179
00:09:09,279 --> 00:09:15,920
with books and articles all that is

180
00:09:12,160 --> 00:09:18,959
external to our brain. But what we then

181
00:09:15,920 --> 00:09:21,839
do we usually just do in our brain. So

182
00:09:18,959 --> 00:09:24,720
it's like brain and the external

183
00:09:21,839 --> 00:09:27,440
environment and that seat custom expands

184
00:09:24,720 --> 00:09:31,040
the personal thinking space

185
00:09:27,440 --> 00:09:34,000
to be able to think within that and I

186
00:09:31,040 --> 00:09:37,360
think that's why Lumman was able to not

187
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:41,120
only be so proficient in his writing but

188
00:09:37,360 --> 00:09:45,600
also be able to develop incredibly

189
00:09:41,120 --> 00:09:49,920
complex thoughts and theories that are

190
00:09:45,600 --> 00:09:52,480
highly consistent um within its itself

191
00:09:49,920 --> 00:09:54,320
uh something that

192
00:09:52,480 --> 00:09:57,920
that wouldn't be possible I think

193
00:09:54,320 --> 00:10:00,880
without a system like that.

194
00:09:57,920 --> 00:10:02,399
>> Right. So there's this other thing I'm

195
00:10:00,880 --> 00:10:05,680
sure you're you're aware of called the

196
00:10:02,399 --> 00:10:07,360
commonplace book. it's it's been famous

197
00:10:05,680 --> 00:10:09,360
in history for for many writers,

198
00:10:07,360 --> 00:10:11,360
Benjamin Franklin

199
00:10:09,360 --> 00:10:13,440
included, is that they they created a

200
00:10:11,360 --> 00:10:16,399
commonplace book where they would note

201
00:10:13,440 --> 00:10:18,160
different references, quotes, ideas that

202
00:10:16,399 --> 00:10:20,399
they would kind of keep with them for

203
00:10:18,160 --> 00:10:22,000
the rest of their lives and that was

204
00:10:20,399 --> 00:10:24,000
always an important part of their

205
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:26,000
writing process. Would you say that the

206
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:28,399
zodoccasted method is kind of like a

207
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:30,399
more complex version of that where

208
00:10:28,399 --> 00:10:32,320
instead of just writing ideas, you're

209
00:10:30,399 --> 00:10:33,920
also connecting

210
00:10:32,320 --> 00:10:35,920
related thoughts?

211
00:10:33,920 --> 00:10:39,839
>> I think it's

212
00:10:35,920 --> 00:10:43,920
certainly um fits into the same category

213
00:10:39,839 --> 00:10:47,839
of trying to use external means to

214
00:10:43,920 --> 00:10:50,320
accompany you and um not just write

215
00:10:47,839 --> 00:10:52,640
something down, put it out, and then go

216
00:10:50,320 --> 00:10:55,600
back to the blank page.

217
00:10:52,640 --> 00:10:58,560
But the settle cousin is certainly more

218
00:10:55,600 --> 00:11:04,560
geared towards continuous development of

219
00:10:58,560 --> 00:11:06,640
ideas and maybe less of a reminder um

220
00:11:04,560 --> 00:11:08,560
and

221
00:11:06,640 --> 00:11:11,760
um

222
00:11:08,560 --> 00:11:13,600
I mean it's grounded in academia but

223
00:11:11,760 --> 00:11:19,680
seeing how much it resonated outside of

224
00:11:13,600 --> 00:11:22,079
academia I think it can be seen as um

225
00:11:19,680 --> 00:11:25,040
maybe a little bit more sophisticated

226
00:11:22,079 --> 00:11:28,880
version of the commonplace book. But you

227
00:11:25,040 --> 00:11:31,760
tell me um you know better I think the

228
00:11:28,880 --> 00:11:34,560
uh distinction between these two

229
00:11:31,760 --> 00:11:36,959
systems.

230
00:11:34,560 --> 00:11:39,760
No, I I would certainly say it's a more

231
00:11:36,959 --> 00:11:43,120
nuanced complex version of a commonplace

232
00:11:39,760 --> 00:11:45,440
book and yet it's also more difficult to

233
00:11:43,120 --> 00:11:47,760
maintain and that's where certain

234
00:11:45,440 --> 00:11:50,240
systems like Obsidian and other like

235
00:11:47,760 --> 00:11:52,560
Rome have kind of come out in many of

236
00:11:50,240 --> 00:11:56,320
the past few years to try to make it

237
00:11:52,560 --> 00:11:58,959
easy to uh create these relationships

238
00:11:56,320 --> 00:12:01,120
between different ideas. in doing so

239
00:11:58,959 --> 00:12:04,880
kind of automatically but in the process

240
00:12:01,120 --> 00:12:06,880
I think they also eliminate your own

241
00:12:04,880 --> 00:12:10,079
intentional connection between these

242
00:12:06,880 --> 00:12:12,320
ideas that perhaps is kind of removes

243
00:12:10,079 --> 00:12:14,320
some of the critical thinking behind

244
00:12:12,320 --> 00:12:16,399
making these connections yourselves uh

245
00:12:14,320 --> 00:12:18,240
because I think there's this aspect of

246
00:12:16,399 --> 00:12:19,920
what you argues you say in the book

247
00:12:18,240 --> 00:12:22,800
writing is not just a record of thought

248
00:12:19,920 --> 00:12:25,279
but the act of thinking itself and so

249
00:12:22,800 --> 00:12:29,279
you argue that this method is a way for

250
00:12:25,279 --> 00:12:31,279
you to to think about these things and

251
00:12:29,279 --> 00:12:32,560
it's it's commonly notated that

252
00:12:31,279 --> 00:12:34,240
obviously thinking about something

253
00:12:32,560 --> 00:12:36,880
whether you're listening to an audio

254
00:12:34,240 --> 00:12:39,120
book whether you're you're reading

255
00:12:36,880 --> 00:12:41,920
something is that we we often don't

256
00:12:39,120 --> 00:12:43,760
remember 95% of what we read in a book

257
00:12:41,920 --> 00:12:45,600
but it's those moments when you come

258
00:12:43,760 --> 00:12:47,519
across an idea you pause and you think

259
00:12:45,600 --> 00:12:49,279
about that thought you think about it

260
00:12:47,519 --> 00:12:51,519
from a different angle you think about

261
00:12:49,279 --> 00:12:53,680
how does this apply to my life you you

262
00:12:51,519 --> 00:12:55,600
expand on that idea those are the types

263
00:12:53,680 --> 00:12:57,440
of things that we tend to remember and

264
00:12:55,600 --> 00:12:59,440
so when you're taking that that kind

265
00:12:57,440 --> 00:13:00,560
that instinctual part where you're

266
00:12:59,440 --> 00:13:02,000
stopping and you're thinking about

267
00:13:00,560 --> 00:13:04,240
something and you're adding it to a

268
00:13:02,000 --> 00:13:06,000
system, then you can look at that and

269
00:13:04,240 --> 00:13:08,800
expand on that further. And so I think

270
00:13:06,000 --> 00:13:12,560
that certainly writing and note-taking

271
00:13:08,800 --> 00:13:15,360
plays an active part of thinking. Um and

272
00:13:12,560 --> 00:13:18,560
so I think everything has its place. Um

273
00:13:15,360 --> 00:13:20,079
but um going off of going on a tangent,

274
00:13:18,560 --> 00:13:21,760
uh do you have any additional thoughts

275
00:13:20,079 --> 00:13:25,760
on top of that? Yeah, I think you strike

276
00:13:21,760 --> 00:13:30,160
an important point and um let me comment

277
00:13:25,760 --> 00:13:34,320
on the role of technology like obsidian

278
00:13:30,160 --> 00:13:38,639
Rome research etc. Um I think there is

279
00:13:34,320 --> 00:13:43,839
the risk that you do exactly what you

280
00:13:38,639 --> 00:13:48,079
just said. Um automate the building of

281
00:13:43,839 --> 00:13:51,680
connection and therefore just skip the

282
00:13:48,079 --> 00:13:54,240
important step of thinking about what

283
00:13:51,680 --> 00:13:58,000
connections make most sense

284
00:13:54,240 --> 00:14:01,839
intellectually or by reasoning. But I

285
00:13:58,000 --> 00:14:04,240
think this kind of technology doesn't

286
00:14:01,839 --> 00:14:07,760
have to

287
00:14:04,240 --> 00:14:10,399
um be used in that way. I think that

288
00:14:07,760 --> 00:14:12,720
technology can

289
00:14:10,399 --> 00:14:16,720
um complement

290
00:14:12,720 --> 00:14:19,839
um our thinking very well if we are

291
00:14:16,720 --> 00:14:22,720
aware of the risk you mentioned um that

292
00:14:19,839 --> 00:14:26,720
we try to use it in a way that that it

293
00:14:22,720 --> 00:14:30,320
skips the thinking part. I think when

294
00:14:26,720 --> 00:14:34,480
you use Obsidian or Rome research or

295
00:14:30,320 --> 00:14:38,639
lock and the other tools out there that

296
00:14:34,480 --> 00:14:40,800
have the birectional linking feature,

297
00:14:38,639 --> 00:14:46,000
um

298
00:14:40,800 --> 00:14:48,959
you get quickly overwhelmed with links

299
00:14:46,000 --> 00:14:53,680
when you automate that process or just

300
00:14:48,959 --> 00:14:56,480
go by association like um oh this word

301
00:14:53,680 --> 00:15:00,079
appears in these notes So I link them

302
00:14:56,480 --> 00:15:03,560
all and I have uh beautiful graphs with

303
00:15:00,079 --> 00:15:03,560
a lot of links

304
00:15:03,600 --> 00:15:11,279
that can work as a warning signal. um

305
00:15:07,440 --> 00:15:14,320
this overwhelming interconnectedness.

306
00:15:11,279 --> 00:15:17,279
Um if you encounter that once, I think

307
00:15:14,320 --> 00:15:21,920
you're thrown back to

308
00:15:17,279 --> 00:15:23,839
uh the inside that any links should be

309
00:15:21,920 --> 00:15:25,440
deliberate

310
00:15:23,839 --> 00:15:27,360
and

311
00:15:25,440 --> 00:15:32,240
ideally

312
00:15:27,360 --> 00:15:36,320
commented on. Um so one of the main uh

313
00:15:32,240 --> 00:15:40,800
points I keep stressing when I teach the

314
00:15:36,320 --> 00:15:46,480
method is try to embed links to other

315
00:15:40,800 --> 00:15:50,240
notes in full sentences. Try to explain

316
00:15:46,480 --> 00:15:52,320
the relation between two notes in a way

317
00:15:50,240 --> 00:15:58,079
that your future self can still

318
00:15:52,320 --> 00:16:02,240
understand that. Um don't try to just um

319
00:15:58,079 --> 00:16:04,320
have bullet points with um links.

320
00:16:02,240 --> 00:16:06,959
They have their place as well, but the

321
00:16:04,320 --> 00:16:10,399
main links should be explained to

322
00:16:06,959 --> 00:16:15,759
yourself. And usually this is the moment

323
00:16:10,399 --> 00:16:18,720
where you start thinking u because

324
00:16:15,759 --> 00:16:20,880
intuitively often um the relation

325
00:16:18,720 --> 00:16:23,440
between two pieces of information is

326
00:16:20,880 --> 00:16:26,720
obvious. um you feel yeah of course this

327
00:16:23,440 --> 00:16:29,120
belongs together but when you try to

328
00:16:26,720 --> 00:16:31,680
make it explicit

329
00:16:29,120 --> 00:16:35,279
you start to struggle and that is

330
00:16:31,680 --> 00:16:37,920
usually the good kind of struggle. Um

331
00:16:35,279 --> 00:16:40,560
first of all you might be right and then

332
00:16:37,920 --> 00:16:44,000
it's good to be able to explain it

333
00:16:40,560 --> 00:16:46,720
because in the end your knowledge isn't

334
00:16:44,000 --> 00:16:49,120
much worth if you're not able to

335
00:16:46,720 --> 00:16:52,079
communicate it. um if you can't tell

336
00:16:49,120 --> 00:16:53,839
someone else how two things belong to

337
00:16:52,079 --> 00:16:58,800
each other.

338
00:16:53,839 --> 00:17:01,600
But most often you realize that

339
00:16:58,800 --> 00:17:03,360
you haven't really thought through um

340
00:17:01,600 --> 00:17:05,679
how two pieces of information belong

341
00:17:03,360 --> 00:17:10,160
together and that you need more

342
00:17:05,679 --> 00:17:15,839
information to make the connection um

343
00:17:10,160 --> 00:17:19,120
plausible. So I think this linking which

344
00:17:15,839 --> 00:17:22,880
can be done mostly automatic

345
00:17:19,120 --> 00:17:27,120
uh if you do it manually where you feel

346
00:17:22,880 --> 00:17:29,919
okay um it's interesting here

347
00:17:27,120 --> 00:17:33,520
can zoom in

348
00:17:29,919 --> 00:17:35,760
the most interesting parts of of what

349
00:17:33,520 --> 00:17:38,080
you're doing. So I think the linking is

350
00:17:35,760 --> 00:17:42,320
not a

351
00:17:38,080 --> 00:17:46,559
support or help. I think it's often the

352
00:17:42,320 --> 00:17:50,000
most important part of the whole process

353
00:17:46,559 --> 00:17:53,360
and the most interesting

354
00:17:50,000 --> 00:17:56,240
>> right and I I would in a easier way of

355
00:17:53,360 --> 00:18:00,000
describing that I think if we look at

356
00:17:56,240 --> 00:18:02,480
say if you are a surgeon and then

357
00:18:00,000 --> 00:18:05,919
perhaps on the side you're you also like

358
00:18:02,480 --> 00:18:08,240
to paint um or you you're in some other

359
00:18:05,919 --> 00:18:11,520
completely unrelated field and it's

360
00:18:08,240 --> 00:18:14,080
often the the people who end up in a

361
00:18:11,520 --> 00:18:17,440
multitude of fields that have interests

362
00:18:14,080 --> 00:18:20,080
and they're able to take those ideas and

363
00:18:17,440 --> 00:18:22,080
overlap them with this other other

364
00:18:20,080 --> 00:18:24,400
profession and that's often where we

365
00:18:22,080 --> 00:18:26,640
have innovations and we have ideas that

366
00:18:24,400 --> 00:18:29,280
kind of further society along because

367
00:18:26,640 --> 00:18:31,600
you have overlapping uh knowledge in

368
00:18:29,280 --> 00:18:34,160
different industries and so I think

369
00:18:31,600 --> 00:18:36,480
these this idea of linking notes it's

370
00:18:34,160 --> 00:18:40,960
kind of like a similar way of you're

371
00:18:36,480 --> 00:18:44,559
you're creating this this this link

372
00:18:40,960 --> 00:18:47,120
between notes and thoughts that perhaps

373
00:18:44,559 --> 00:18:49,840
otherwise could be unrelated. It's

374
00:18:47,120 --> 00:18:53,280
forcing yourself to think about a a

375
00:18:49,840 --> 00:18:55,280
specific idea in a different way instead

376
00:18:53,280 --> 00:18:57,280
of just looking at it in a in a linear

377
00:18:55,280 --> 00:18:58,559
way, which is so often what we do,

378
00:18:57,280 --> 00:19:00,960
especially when we're just creating

379
00:18:58,559 --> 00:19:02,240
bullet points. when if if we have

380
00:19:00,960 --> 00:19:03,919
highlights on a book, you know, we're

381
00:19:02,240 --> 00:19:05,600
we're putting it into a specific

382
00:19:03,919 --> 00:19:07,600
category and then we put, you know, if

383
00:19:05,600 --> 00:19:09,440
it's a category on productivity, all all

384
00:19:07,600 --> 00:19:11,440
of these notes might just just be in

385
00:19:09,440 --> 00:19:13,760
this one one category, but there's

386
00:19:11,440 --> 00:19:16,160
inevitably related I philosophical

387
00:19:13,760 --> 00:19:18,240
ideas, industry ideas that you could

388
00:19:16,160 --> 00:19:20,400
think about and that could be what

389
00:19:18,240 --> 00:19:23,280
allows you to have kind of new creative

390
00:19:20,400 --> 00:19:25,360
thinking and to write and and think from

391
00:19:23,280 --> 00:19:28,559
a different perspective than most other

392
00:19:25,360 --> 00:19:30,320
people would. Yeah, I think the art is

393
00:19:28,559 --> 00:19:33,840
to

394
00:19:30,320 --> 00:19:35,919
um find the right

395
00:19:33,840 --> 00:19:40,640
level of abstraction.

396
00:19:35,919 --> 00:19:43,919
Um on a two abstract um level everything

397
00:19:40,640 --> 00:19:48,080
is related. And

398
00:19:43,919 --> 00:19:52,960
if you try to find the

399
00:19:48,080 --> 00:19:55,120
uh the abstraction level where two

400
00:19:52,960 --> 00:20:00,720
uh until now unconnected pieces of

401
00:19:55,120 --> 00:20:05,120
information can be put together. Um you

402
00:20:00,720 --> 00:20:06,559
you create something new and

403
00:20:05,120 --> 00:20:09,440
especially when you work

404
00:20:06,559 --> 00:20:12,720
interdisciplinary and into very

405
00:20:09,440 --> 00:20:16,000
different fields like medicine and art.

406
00:20:12,720 --> 00:20:20,640
um you need to go to a more abstract

407
00:20:16,000 --> 00:20:23,919
level but then also to respppecify

408
00:20:20,640 --> 00:20:27,600
um from that level down to have a

409
00:20:23,919 --> 00:20:30,720
concrete example or uh application of

410
00:20:27,600 --> 00:20:34,000
that idea. I think that's where models

411
00:20:30,720 --> 00:20:37,360
are extremely useful and have their

412
00:20:34,000 --> 00:20:40,400
place because models are always

413
00:20:37,360 --> 00:20:42,880
abstractions from reality but they

414
00:20:40,400 --> 00:20:45,200
extremely useful uh because they are not

415
00:20:42,880 --> 00:20:48,559
that abstract that you can't do anything

416
00:20:45,200 --> 00:20:52,480
with them anymore. You can reapply them

417
00:20:48,559 --> 00:20:54,640
on a more concrete level. Um,

418
00:20:52,480 --> 00:20:57,919
yeah, sometimes people shy away a little

419
00:20:54,640 --> 00:20:59,919
bit from too abstract ideas or abstract

420
00:20:57,919 --> 00:21:05,280
ideas, but I think it's often

421
00:20:59,919 --> 00:21:08,640
unavoidable to go that step to go back

422
00:21:05,280 --> 00:21:10,559
um to a more concrete level in a

423
00:21:08,640 --> 00:21:13,840
different field.

424
00:21:10,559 --> 00:21:17,240
Um, yeah, that that's certainly what's

425
00:21:13,840 --> 00:21:17,240
getting interesting.

426
00:21:17,280 --> 00:21:22,960
>> Yeah. And and so you also say that notes

427
00:21:20,240 --> 00:21:25,440
are only as valuable as the system that

428
00:21:22,960 --> 00:21:27,919
they're embedded in. And so from a

429
00:21:25,440 --> 00:21:29,919
perspective of of building a zetocasten

430
00:21:27,919 --> 00:21:34,480
system, I know that we we touched on

431
00:21:29,919 --> 00:21:36,880
Obsidian and Rome and u I believe uh

432
00:21:34,480 --> 00:21:38,559
Lumen, you know, he he had these index

433
00:21:36,880 --> 00:21:40,799
cards, right? And so he was able to

434
00:21:38,559 --> 00:21:43,360
write over 60 books, uh hundreds of

435
00:21:40,799 --> 00:21:46,080
articles, and he had like I think some

436
00:21:43,360 --> 00:21:48,159
90,000 index cards. And there's a very

437
00:21:46,080 --> 00:21:49,919
specific method of of putting like

438
00:21:48,159 --> 00:21:52,240
notations in the upper right hand corner

439
00:21:49,919 --> 00:21:56,159
to to link like specifically where this

440
00:21:52,240 --> 00:21:58,480
should go. And a lot of that is a very

441
00:21:56,159 --> 00:22:00,320
uh uh

442
00:21:58,480 --> 00:22:02,320
process. It's very it's very resource

443
00:22:00,320 --> 00:22:04,880
intensive right to create a system like

444
00:22:02,320 --> 00:22:08,000
this. And I know say Ryan Holidayiday

445
00:22:04,880 --> 00:22:10,640
very famous author and in stoicism realm

446
00:22:08,000 --> 00:22:13,200
who was a protege of grav who wrote the

447
00:22:10,640 --> 00:22:15,360
48 laws of power. He's mentioned his

448
00:22:13,200 --> 00:22:17,760
system where he he will read a book. He

449
00:22:15,360 --> 00:22:19,039
he manually highlights everything in the

450
00:22:17,760 --> 00:22:21,200
book and then he goes back through the

451
00:22:19,039 --> 00:22:23,120
book and he manually writes down every

452
00:22:21,200 --> 00:22:24,960
single highlight and then he will go

453
00:22:23,120 --> 00:22:27,039
through that and then process that

454
00:22:24,960 --> 00:22:29,039
highlight. I think perhaps that's what

455
00:22:27,039 --> 00:22:31,760
allows him to produce such extraordinary

456
00:22:29,039 --> 00:22:34,080
work and to be such a deep thinker but

457
00:22:31,760 --> 00:22:35,520
also that's it's very resource

458
00:22:34,080 --> 00:22:37,440
intensive. You know, it's it's not

459
00:22:35,520 --> 00:22:39,760
something that everybody has a lot of

460
00:22:37,440 --> 00:22:41,360
time for. So perhaps that's where these

461
00:22:39,760 --> 00:22:43,440
systems like Obsidian and Rome kind of

462
00:22:41,360 --> 00:22:46,720
come into play where they make the

463
00:22:43,440 --> 00:22:49,760
process of linking ideas easier even

464
00:22:46,720 --> 00:22:52,000
though it's perhaps at the risk of

465
00:22:49,760 --> 00:22:53,919
losing some of that internal creative

466
00:22:52,000 --> 00:22:57,760
thinking around linking these ideas

467
00:22:53,919 --> 00:23:00,640
yourself. Um which can itself spawn some

468
00:22:57,760 --> 00:23:03,200
some new ideas instead of just letting a

469
00:23:00,640 --> 00:23:05,600
system do it for you. Um so I guess the

470
00:23:03,200 --> 00:23:07,200
question is kind of what is the what is

471
00:23:05,600 --> 00:23:09,120
the middle ground? I suppose if you're

472
00:23:07,200 --> 00:23:11,200
somebody like Ryan Holidayiday who you

473
00:23:09,120 --> 00:23:12,640
know his your sole job as a writer then

474
00:23:11,200 --> 00:23:15,600
perhaps you have the time and the

475
00:23:12,640 --> 00:23:17,200
resources to be manually documenting

476
00:23:15,600 --> 00:23:20,080
highlights to be thinking about them and

477
00:23:17,200 --> 00:23:22,400
to maintain a very complex system. Um

478
00:23:20,080 --> 00:23:24,240
I'm wondering where where do you see

479
00:23:22,400 --> 00:23:26,400
your students in this regard? where you

480
00:23:24,240 --> 00:23:28,640
see most people who perhaps they're

481
00:23:26,400 --> 00:23:30,400
entrepreneurs, perhaps they're writers,

482
00:23:28,640 --> 00:23:33,440
perhaps they're they're influencers or

483
00:23:30,400 --> 00:23:35,760
or content creators and they they look

484
00:23:33,440 --> 00:23:37,840
at something like this as being

485
00:23:35,760 --> 00:23:40,320
beneficial to their content creation

486
00:23:37,840 --> 00:23:42,559
process, but they don't have all this

487
00:23:40,320 --> 00:23:44,320
time, you know, and don't want to ex

488
00:23:42,559 --> 00:23:46,080
exude all of their mental energy and

489
00:23:44,320 --> 00:23:47,760
trying to create these relationships

490
00:23:46,080 --> 00:23:49,840
between these different ideas. So, kind

491
00:23:47,760 --> 00:23:53,280
of what do you what do you say there and

492
00:23:49,840 --> 00:23:55,919
what do you recommend? Um, I look at it

493
00:23:53,280 --> 00:23:58,640
slightly differently. Um, I think you

494
00:23:55,919 --> 00:24:02,480
can set up this system

495
00:23:58,640 --> 00:24:04,640
on a weekend and get going. You you're

496
00:24:02,480 --> 00:24:08,000
still learning along the way and you

497
00:24:04,640 --> 00:24:10,640
have to adjust the system and in a way

498
00:24:08,000 --> 00:24:14,159
it never finishes. So, I'm still

499
00:24:10,640 --> 00:24:17,200
learning how to apply it and modify it

500
00:24:14,159 --> 00:24:21,200
to my needs because my thinking develops

501
00:24:17,200 --> 00:24:23,840
and the structure changes. So, uh, it

502
00:24:21,200 --> 00:24:28,080
has an effect on the way I structure my

503
00:24:23,840 --> 00:24:29,840
notes, but the basic setup that allows

504
00:24:28,080 --> 00:24:33,200
you

505
00:24:29,840 --> 00:24:36,159
whenever you have an idea to put them

506
00:24:33,200 --> 00:24:40,320
into a designated space where you know

507
00:24:36,159 --> 00:24:43,840
it's not lost, but can be

508
00:24:40,320 --> 00:24:48,240
used to build something bigger.

509
00:24:43,840 --> 00:24:50,559
that doesn't need more than a weekend or

510
00:24:48,240 --> 00:24:53,279
an extended weekend.

511
00:24:50,559 --> 00:24:57,279
The main difference you describe, I

512
00:24:53,279 --> 00:24:59,679
think, uh, is in regard to what kind of

513
00:24:57,279 --> 00:25:02,159
input you deal with. When Ryan

514
00:24:59,679 --> 00:25:06,400
Holidayiday reads Zenica,

515
00:25:02,159 --> 00:25:11,919
of course, he needs more time uh to go

516
00:25:06,400 --> 00:25:15,360
through a book and ponder about

517
00:25:11,919 --> 00:25:18,360
sentences within the context of the

518
00:25:15,360 --> 00:25:18,360
text.

519
00:25:18,799 --> 00:25:24,080
I like to say when you write a

520
00:25:21,039 --> 00:25:26,960
literature note, so the note that gives

521
00:25:24,080 --> 00:25:28,640
an account of the literature um you're

522
00:25:26,960 --> 00:25:31,360
processing,

523
00:25:28,640 --> 00:25:34,000
I'm often asked, well, what's

524
00:25:31,360 --> 00:25:36,000
what's your regular time? Um am I taking

525
00:25:34,000 --> 00:25:38,960
too long? Am I going too fast through

526
00:25:36,000 --> 00:25:40,799
it? And the correct answer is of course,

527
00:25:38,960 --> 00:25:43,200
well, it it depends on the kind of

528
00:25:40,799 --> 00:25:46,400
literature you're working with. The

529
00:25:43,200 --> 00:25:49,440
appropriate amount to spend on writing a

530
00:25:46,400 --> 00:25:52,320
literature note is somewhere between a

531
00:25:49,440 --> 00:25:55,039
second and a lifetime. I mean there are

532
00:25:52,320 --> 00:25:58,720
people who who read the Bible for all

533
00:25:55,039 --> 00:26:02,799
their year life and still find new

534
00:25:58,720 --> 00:26:06,559
things. And I'm sure Ryan Holidayiday

535
00:26:02,799 --> 00:26:10,559
um has read Zenica um more than once

536
00:26:06,559 --> 00:26:13,600
because he finds new

537
00:26:10,559 --> 00:26:16,559
um angles to it with a different life

538
00:26:13,600 --> 00:26:19,039
experience. Um you often have these

539
00:26:16,559 --> 00:26:21,200
encounters with ideas where you think,

540
00:26:19,039 --> 00:26:23,440
"Yeah, yeah, okay, that's interesting."

541
00:26:21,200 --> 00:26:27,760
And a few years later, you open the book

542
00:26:23,440 --> 00:26:31,039
again and suddenly it hits you, oh, now

543
00:26:27,760 --> 00:26:34,720
I understand. um

544
00:26:31,039 --> 00:26:38,960
with my experience now I I see the depth

545
00:26:34,720 --> 00:26:43,520
and the relevance of that or you read

546
00:26:38,960 --> 00:26:46,159
something and you grasp the idea from

547
00:26:43,520 --> 00:26:48,720
page one. It's actually already in the

548
00:26:46,159 --> 00:26:51,200
title and the rest of the book is just a

549
00:26:48,720 --> 00:26:54,400
variation on the same idea over and over

550
00:26:51,200 --> 00:26:57,520
and over again. So you don't need to

551
00:26:54,400 --> 00:27:04,000
read it twice. maybe just skim through

552
00:26:57,520 --> 00:27:06,799
it all. Um so I think how much time you

553
00:27:04,000 --> 00:27:10,400
have to spend on

554
00:27:06,799 --> 00:27:13,360
um creating the system, developing it,

555
00:27:10,400 --> 00:27:15,440
writing your notes, connecting them

556
00:27:13,360 --> 00:27:21,120
really depends on what you're dealing

557
00:27:15,440 --> 00:27:24,320
with. And there are some some books I

558
00:27:21,120 --> 00:27:27,279
highlight a lot and go through twice

559
00:27:24,320 --> 00:27:31,919
because I feel I can't give a proper

560
00:27:27,279 --> 00:27:34,159
account on what's in there before I

561
00:27:31,919 --> 00:27:36,000
haven't read the the whole bit because

562
00:27:34,159 --> 00:27:38,480
some pieces of information only make

563
00:27:36,000 --> 00:27:40,480
sense after you know what's in the last

564
00:27:38,480 --> 00:27:44,240
chapter and then go back to the

565
00:27:40,480 --> 00:27:46,000
beginning. And then there are articles

566
00:27:44,240 --> 00:27:47,520
like I said where you have all the

567
00:27:46,000 --> 00:27:51,200
information

568
00:27:47,520 --> 00:27:54,000
already in the title.

569
00:27:51,200 --> 00:27:55,679
>> So it's it's possible to spend as I I

570
00:27:54,000 --> 00:27:58,159
love I love what you said, you know, a

571
00:27:55,679 --> 00:28:01,840
second to a lifetime in terms of going

572
00:27:58,159 --> 00:28:04,960
over a note and thinking about uh a

573
00:28:01,840 --> 00:28:08,159
specific idea. And so now we've

574
00:28:04,960 --> 00:28:10,799
mentioned a few times like Rome obsidian

575
00:28:08,159 --> 00:28:13,679
and I believe you now teach a a course

576
00:28:10,799 --> 00:28:16,320
on Obsidian, but before I ask you about

577
00:28:13,679 --> 00:28:19,120
that, I'd love to ask you about kind of

578
00:28:16,320 --> 00:28:22,159
the most common methods that perhaps

579
00:28:19,120 --> 00:28:23,760
people of today can use uh or build a

580
00:28:22,159 --> 00:28:25,679
system like this. I think we have

581
00:28:23,760 --> 00:28:28,399
popular tools like like notion,

582
00:28:25,679 --> 00:28:31,200
Evernotes, Google Docs. I'm wondering is

583
00:28:28,399 --> 00:28:32,880
there uh so say besides Obsidian which I

584
00:28:31,200 --> 00:28:35,840
suppose is probably looked at is like

585
00:28:32,880 --> 00:28:38,000
the the one of the best versions of of

586
00:28:35,840 --> 00:28:41,279
the built based specifically on the

587
00:28:38,000 --> 00:28:43,279
Zillow caston system. Uh do you see the

588
00:28:41,279 --> 00:28:45,679
possibility of using any of these other

589
00:28:43,279 --> 00:28:48,640
tools like Evernote, uh notion, Google

590
00:28:45,679 --> 00:28:50,559
Docs as being able to build such a

591
00:28:48,640 --> 00:28:53,440
system within?

592
00:28:50,559 --> 00:28:57,120
>> Well, some people use them and seem to

593
00:28:53,440 --> 00:29:01,200
be happy with it. Um I can't imagine

594
00:28:57,120 --> 00:29:03,919
myself uh working with

595
00:29:01,200 --> 00:29:06,640
apps that are

596
00:29:03,919 --> 00:29:09,679
not designed for interconnectedness but

597
00:29:06,640 --> 00:29:13,520
where you have to

598
00:29:09,679 --> 00:29:16,640
build your own little workarounds and um

599
00:29:13,520 --> 00:29:20,080
in the end often they apply a similar

600
00:29:16,640 --> 00:29:22,000
system like Luman did where you manually

601
00:29:20,080 --> 00:29:24,960
um ID

602
00:29:22,000 --> 00:29:28,240
um pieces of information and and link

603
00:29:24,960 --> 00:29:32,000
them manually. I feel that distracts me

604
00:29:28,240 --> 00:29:35,760
from uh the content. So I'm extremely

605
00:29:32,000 --> 00:29:41,279
thankful for um the people who developed

606
00:29:35,760 --> 00:29:44,279
Obidian and Rome research just to

607
00:29:41,279 --> 00:29:44,279
um

608
00:29:44,399 --> 00:29:50,080
push the development of these um note

609
00:29:47,200 --> 00:29:52,880
takingaking apps into a new direction.

610
00:29:50,080 --> 00:30:00,480
Um, and

611
00:29:52,880 --> 00:30:05,039
I feel it um it's almost like you um you

612
00:30:00,480 --> 00:30:08,640
take the um foot from the brake and um

613
00:30:05,039 --> 00:30:10,880
it's so much smoother when you can link

614
00:30:08,640 --> 00:30:14,880
and you have the back link and you don't

615
00:30:10,880 --> 00:30:16,320
have to worry about iding and stuff like

616
00:30:14,880 --> 00:30:20,000
that.

617
00:30:16,320 --> 00:30:23,120
So I feel that there was a big shift um

618
00:30:20,000 --> 00:30:24,960
from apps that were mainly designed for

619
00:30:23,120 --> 00:30:26,960
collecting information, storing

620
00:30:24,960 --> 00:30:28,480
information

621
00:30:26,960 --> 00:30:30,960
um

622
00:30:28,480 --> 00:30:33,919
folder based

623
00:30:30,960 --> 00:30:36,399
um and

624
00:30:33,919 --> 00:30:39,840
yeah you can you can certainly do

625
00:30:36,399 --> 00:30:43,080
something with them but um

626
00:30:39,840 --> 00:30:43,080
I feel

627
00:30:43,200 --> 00:30:48,480
there was a breakthrough uh for in the

628
00:30:45,840 --> 00:30:51,360
digital I always struggled um because

629
00:30:48,480 --> 00:30:54,640
there are some elements of the analog

630
00:30:51,360 --> 00:30:57,200
working with pen and paper I I like so

631
00:30:54,640 --> 00:30:59,840
much um I still miss them when I work

632
00:30:57,200 --> 00:31:05,120
digitally but now with this new

633
00:30:59,840 --> 00:31:06,640
generation of apps I feel the advantages

634
00:31:05,120 --> 00:31:09,640
um

635
00:31:06,640 --> 00:31:09,640
are

636
00:31:10,640 --> 00:31:16,960
are so obvious that um the disadvantages

637
00:31:14,799 --> 00:31:20,080
of the digital

638
00:31:16,960 --> 00:31:24,880
um slightly fade in the into the

639
00:31:20,080 --> 00:31:26,640
background. Um you I still miss the

640
00:31:24,880 --> 00:31:30,080
spatiality,

641
00:31:26,640 --> 00:31:32,720
the haptics of it, the

642
00:31:30,080 --> 00:31:34,399
the kind of writing that's really

643
00:31:32,720 --> 00:31:36,720
undistracted.

644
00:31:34,399 --> 00:31:40,559
Um

645
00:31:36,720 --> 00:31:43,840
that you can still do that. Um but it's

646
00:31:40,559 --> 00:31:46,559
but it's then outside of the system. Um,

647
00:31:43,840 --> 00:31:50,000
yeah.

648
00:31:46,559 --> 00:31:52,640
>> Right. And so, Obsidian seems like the

649
00:31:50,000 --> 00:31:54,880
like the main feature. Uh, I'm wondering

650
00:31:52,640 --> 00:31:57,039
if you can describe kind of your use

651
00:31:54,880 --> 00:32:00,240
case or or some of the best cases you've

652
00:31:57,039 --> 00:32:04,240
heard from other people in terms of how

653
00:32:00,240 --> 00:32:07,039
Obsidian specifically uh is is uh one of

654
00:32:04,240 --> 00:32:09,039
the best methods for for helping them to

655
00:32:07,039 --> 00:32:11,200
link ideas. C. Can you kind of describe

656
00:32:09,039 --> 00:32:13,440
like the the visual mapping feature and

657
00:32:11,200 --> 00:32:15,760
kind of what you think really makes

658
00:32:13,440 --> 00:32:16,559
Obsidian itself stand out for for the

659
00:32:15,760 --> 00:32:19,039
Zettocast system?

660
00:32:16,559 --> 00:32:22,960
>> The weird thing is I think the main

661
00:32:19,039 --> 00:32:26,320
reason I like Obsidian is

662
00:32:22,960 --> 00:32:29,279
really hard to describe. It's um it's

663
00:32:26,320 --> 00:32:33,039
just the feeling of being immersed in

664
00:32:29,279 --> 00:32:36,159
your thoughts with it. while I used

665
00:32:33,039 --> 00:32:41,039
wrong research for a while and I liked

666
00:32:36,159 --> 00:32:46,080
it, but I always felt like almost

667
00:32:41,039 --> 00:32:50,559
um distant from it. It's almost like I'm

668
00:32:46,080 --> 00:32:55,600
outside and looking at my notes

669
00:32:50,559 --> 00:33:00,960
and have to apply a more

670
00:32:55,600 --> 00:33:04,799
um prefrontal cortex like approach to it

671
00:33:00,960 --> 00:33:08,559
all and obsidian

672
00:33:04,799 --> 00:33:11,919
um more fades into the background as a

673
00:33:08,559 --> 00:33:15,519
tool and I feel much more immersed in

674
00:33:11,919 --> 00:33:20,480
thoughts. So my my theory is it's

675
00:33:15,519 --> 00:33:25,039
because it allows you to use your screen

676
00:33:20,480 --> 00:33:29,840
better by having multiple notes open by

677
00:33:25,039 --> 00:33:32,799
stacking them by um going more quickly

678
00:33:29,840 --> 00:33:37,840
through different notes

679
00:33:32,799 --> 00:33:39,840
um and thereby having some kind of

680
00:33:37,840 --> 00:33:41,760
orientation.

681
00:33:39,840 --> 00:33:45,840
Um

682
00:33:41,760 --> 00:33:48,000
and the way I teach the title of

683
00:33:45,840 --> 00:33:51,760
customers obsidian

684
00:33:48,000 --> 00:33:56,559
very much tries to

685
00:33:51,760 --> 00:33:59,279
focus on building that kind of

686
00:33:56,559 --> 00:34:02,559
experience of having an orientation

687
00:33:59,279 --> 00:34:05,360
within your notes despite of the chances

688
00:34:02,559 --> 00:34:09,119
to stumbling upon something.

689
00:34:05,360 --> 00:34:11,280
um to get as close as possible to the

690
00:34:09,119 --> 00:34:13,440
original set of customer experience with

691
00:34:11,280 --> 00:34:15,040
pen and paper.

692
00:34:13,440 --> 00:34:18,639
And

693
00:34:15,040 --> 00:34:20,639
>> that needs some

694
00:34:18,639 --> 00:34:22,320
structure

695
00:34:20,639 --> 00:34:26,800
that

696
00:34:22,320 --> 00:34:32,960
um took me a while to figure out. So

697
00:34:26,800 --> 00:34:37,520
Obsidian is not a tool you can open and

698
00:34:32,960 --> 00:34:41,760
just use. Its

699
00:34:37,520 --> 00:34:46,000
main advantage is at the same time its

700
00:34:41,760 --> 00:34:48,639
biggest risk. You can

701
00:34:46,000 --> 00:34:51,520
do almost anything with it and you can

702
00:34:48,639 --> 00:34:54,720
use it in all kinds of ways

703
00:34:51,520 --> 00:34:58,480
and if you don't

704
00:34:54,720 --> 00:35:00,400
have figured out a good structure um

705
00:34:58,480 --> 00:35:05,920
you're lost.

706
00:35:00,400 --> 00:35:08,720
And so what I try to um provide is the

707
00:35:05,920 --> 00:35:13,040
experience-based structure that then

708
00:35:08,720 --> 00:35:16,160
allows you to quickly u focus on your

709
00:35:13,040 --> 00:35:19,200
thoughts instead of thinking too much

710
00:35:16,160 --> 00:35:22,320
about how to set it up, how to structure

711
00:35:19,200 --> 00:35:24,640
it. And

712
00:35:22,320 --> 00:35:26,320
for some it goes a little bit against

713
00:35:24,640 --> 00:35:29,040
the

714
00:35:26,320 --> 00:35:33,119
bottom up approach of the set of custom

715
00:35:29,040 --> 00:35:36,720
where you develop structure from uh from

716
00:35:33,119 --> 00:35:39,200
the bottom up and you collect nodes see

717
00:35:36,720 --> 00:35:42,720
how they fit together and then figure

718
00:35:39,200 --> 00:35:45,760
out okay what's the structure here um

719
00:35:42,720 --> 00:35:48,320
how do these things belong together

720
00:35:45,760 --> 00:35:51,520
because you you already start with some

721
00:35:48,320 --> 00:35:53,920
kind of hierarchy top down,

722
00:35:51,520 --> 00:35:56,079
but it doesn't

723
00:35:53,920 --> 00:35:58,880
um

724
00:35:56,079 --> 00:36:02,240
hardwire anything into this system. You

725
00:35:58,880 --> 00:36:06,800
can always change the structure

726
00:36:02,240 --> 00:36:09,119
when your thinking changes because in a

727
00:36:06,800 --> 00:36:11,680
way the way we think about things is the

728
00:36:09,119 --> 00:36:13,920
way we structure things. So it it needs

729
00:36:11,680 --> 00:36:17,920
to change something that couldn't be

730
00:36:13,920 --> 00:36:20,320
done with a classical folder structure.

731
00:36:17,920 --> 00:36:24,880
Um but I think it's justified because

732
00:36:20,320 --> 00:36:26,800
when people start with

733
00:36:24,880 --> 00:36:29,520
cast and obsidian

734
00:36:26,800 --> 00:36:31,520
they don't start from scratch. Um you

735
00:36:29,520 --> 00:36:33,599
don't have to pretend you know nothing.

736
00:36:31,520 --> 00:36:37,119
You don't structure your thoughts. Um

737
00:36:33,599 --> 00:36:40,240
you have to build it first. We always

738
00:36:37,119 --> 00:36:42,720
already have an idea how we structure

739
00:36:40,240 --> 00:36:45,280
things. Um we have different areas of

740
00:36:42,720 --> 00:36:46,880
interest or different areas of

741
00:36:45,280 --> 00:36:50,320
responsibility.

742
00:36:46,880 --> 00:36:53,119
we um have different questions. So it

743
00:36:50,320 --> 00:36:57,040
makes sense to start at the beginning to

744
00:36:53,119 --> 00:37:03,599
make this structure explicit.

745
00:36:57,040 --> 00:37:09,599
Uh use it as the scaffold you can then

746
00:37:03,599 --> 00:37:15,760
add new ideas onto and change it when it

747
00:37:09,599 --> 00:37:19,359
needs changing. Um and this structure

748
00:37:15,760 --> 00:37:22,160
is something that

749
00:37:19,359 --> 00:37:27,520
in my opinion

750
00:37:22,160 --> 00:37:30,960
um is to some degree an alternative to

751
00:37:27,520 --> 00:37:32,880
the haptic orientation you have with the

752
00:37:30,960 --> 00:37:35,680
analog set.

753
00:37:32,880 --> 00:37:41,119
So in the analog set you always knew

754
00:37:35,680 --> 00:37:45,200
okay um my my notes on on writing and

755
00:37:41,119 --> 00:37:49,359
thinking are somewhere on the left

756
00:37:45,200 --> 00:37:52,240
bottom drawer and um I kind of know how

757
00:37:49,359 --> 00:37:56,400
the notes feel because of

758
00:37:52,240 --> 00:37:59,520
um used them so often or you know it was

759
00:37:56,400 --> 00:38:02,480
a beloved burke you you kind of know

760
00:37:59,520 --> 00:38:06,400
where the things are. um you don't have

761
00:38:02,480 --> 00:38:09,200
that in the digital form but you have

762
00:38:06,400 --> 00:38:11,599
other means of orientation

763
00:38:09,200 --> 00:38:14,560
uh within obsidian.

764
00:38:11,599 --> 00:38:16,880
Some of them are built in

765
00:38:14,560 --> 00:38:20,000
but

766
00:38:16,880 --> 00:38:23,839
most of them you need to create yourself

767
00:38:20,000 --> 00:38:27,520
or use um a preconfigured

768
00:38:23,839 --> 00:38:30,720
uh structure you can then tweak and

769
00:38:27,520 --> 00:38:33,760
adjust to your own needs. Um I think

770
00:38:30,720 --> 00:38:38,160
that's that's the challenge of these

771
00:38:33,760 --> 00:38:43,040
ingenious uh apps that they are so open

772
00:38:38,160 --> 00:38:47,760
uh that at the same time you need to

773
00:38:43,040 --> 00:38:49,040
restrict uh the openness again with your

774
00:38:47,760 --> 00:38:52,240
own

775
00:38:49,040 --> 00:38:54,800
>> ideas. Yeah.

776
00:38:52,240 --> 00:38:57,599
>> Yeah. I I think one way of looking at it

777
00:38:54,800 --> 00:39:00,079
perhaps is that Obsidian itself provides

778
00:38:57,599 --> 00:39:02,000
kind of the foundation but then you need

779
00:39:00,079 --> 00:39:03,440
to be the architect and decide you know

780
00:39:02,000 --> 00:39:06,880
how are you going to build on that

781
00:39:03,440 --> 00:39:08,880
foundation and I know I I first time I

782
00:39:06,880 --> 00:39:11,680
tried to use Obsidian I was completely

783
00:39:08,880 --> 00:39:13,839
overwhelmed and I I was like this is way

784
00:39:11,680 --> 00:39:16,400
too much for me because you have to

785
00:39:13,839 --> 00:39:18,560
approach it um it's not it's not like a

786
00:39:16,400 --> 00:39:20,240
tool like Evernote or Google Docs where

787
00:39:18,560 --> 00:39:21,920
everything is kind of laid out and it's

788
00:39:20,240 --> 00:39:24,640
like if you you you know that you're

789
00:39:21,920 --> 00:39:27,200
going to put a note into a folder and or

790
00:39:24,640 --> 00:39:29,040
a notebook and that's that's they they

791
00:39:27,200 --> 00:39:31,040
provide the structure you know they are

792
00:39:29,040 --> 00:39:33,200
the architects of that system and when

793
00:39:31,040 --> 00:39:35,520
it comes to the is having a zilloccast

794
00:39:33,200 --> 00:39:37,520
system whether you're using an analog or

795
00:39:35,520 --> 00:39:40,240
a software version is that you are still

796
00:39:37,520 --> 00:39:42,400
having to develop the structure of how

797
00:39:40,240 --> 00:39:44,400
you are storing this information and now

798
00:39:42,400 --> 00:39:46,079
I think Obsidian and Rome you know they

799
00:39:44,400 --> 00:39:47,920
they try to take some of that out

800
00:39:46,079 --> 00:39:50,160
because I think what allows them to be

801
00:39:47,920 --> 00:39:51,920
so popular is their kind of intuitive

802
00:39:50,160 --> 00:39:54,400
kind of visual linking it's like

803
00:39:51,920 --> 00:39:56,480
birectional linking system where where

804
00:39:54,400 --> 00:39:58,800
you can create these these links that go

805
00:39:56,480 --> 00:40:01,520
between your notes back and forth. And I

806
00:39:58,800 --> 00:40:04,240
love the the mind mapping functionality.

807
00:40:01,520 --> 00:40:06,160
And I think a tool a tool like this is

808
00:40:04,240 --> 00:40:08,960
probably the closest that we can get to

809
00:40:06,160 --> 00:40:11,040
right now of having an interior view of

810
00:40:08,960 --> 00:40:13,520
of your brain. And I think that that's

811
00:40:11,040 --> 00:40:16,000
why it resonates so so much with so many

812
00:40:13,520 --> 00:40:18,960
people because it's the the way that the

813
00:40:16,000 --> 00:40:21,760
structure is oriented is closer to how

814
00:40:18,960 --> 00:40:24,000
we think than I think any other other

815
00:40:21,760 --> 00:40:26,320
method that has you know that we've

816
00:40:24,000 --> 00:40:28,880
thought of up until now. And so that's

817
00:40:26,320 --> 00:40:31,440
why I love when you say that Obsidian it

818
00:40:28,880 --> 00:40:33,599
feels like you're you're viewing into

819
00:40:31,440 --> 00:40:35,839
your brain in a way. Um, and that's

820
00:40:33,599 --> 00:40:38,720
that's if you maintain it and if you're

821
00:40:35,839 --> 00:40:40,480
not kind of uh taken a back and just

822
00:40:38,720 --> 00:40:42,400
decide to to look elsewhere because you

823
00:40:40,480 --> 00:40:43,839
just feel so overwhelmed. And I suppose

824
00:40:42,400 --> 00:40:45,760
that's kind of what your course is

825
00:40:43,839 --> 00:40:47,440
about, right? C, can you kind of explain

826
00:40:45,760 --> 00:40:49,520
explain a little bit about your your

827
00:40:47,440 --> 00:40:52,160
course uh what you teach and who you

828
00:40:49,520 --> 00:40:56,160
think uh should consider uh signing up?

829
00:40:52,160 --> 00:40:59,359
Yeah, I mean first of all the I I agree

830
00:40:56,160 --> 00:41:03,839
that um

831
00:40:59,359 --> 00:41:07,280
it it is the closest maybe to the way we

832
00:41:03,839 --> 00:41:10,240
structure internally. So it is like a

833
00:41:07,280 --> 00:41:13,040
second brain but I see it more as a

834
00:41:10,240 --> 00:41:15,599
dialogue partner and that's how the

835
00:41:13,040 --> 00:41:19,839
course is designed to

836
00:41:15,599 --> 00:41:23,520
um build a dialogue partner along the

837
00:41:19,839 --> 00:41:26,880
way. Um, and I I like the metaphor of

838
00:41:23,520 --> 00:41:29,760
the dialogue partner better than the

839
00:41:26,880 --> 00:41:32,079
second brain metaphor because the second

840
00:41:29,760 --> 00:41:34,160
brain metaphor

841
00:41:32,079 --> 00:41:37,839
um,

842
00:41:34,160 --> 00:41:41,200
it insinuates you you look at yourself.

843
00:41:37,839 --> 00:41:43,119
But when I interact with my subtle cast,

844
00:41:41,200 --> 00:41:45,760
I don't feel like I'm interacting with

845
00:41:43,119 --> 00:41:50,560
myself. like I feel like I'm interacting

846
00:41:45,760 --> 00:41:56,480
with a different entity that challenges

847
00:41:50,560 --> 00:42:00,720
me with information I I I don't remember

848
00:41:56,480 --> 00:42:04,240
and or I remember in the moment um I'm

849
00:42:00,720 --> 00:42:06,800
confronted with it. Uh but these moments

850
00:42:04,240 --> 00:42:09,520
of oh um I think you forgot something

851
00:42:06,800 --> 00:42:11,680
here or um you have written about that

852
00:42:09,520 --> 00:42:15,280
before and in a slightly different way

853
00:42:11,680 --> 00:42:17,839
or I'd take a literature note and um

854
00:42:15,280 --> 00:42:20,000
look up a reference in a paper and say

855
00:42:17,839 --> 00:42:23,359
well I don't understand it like that. So

856
00:42:20,000 --> 00:42:26,160
the authors um I think they got it wrong

857
00:42:23,359 --> 00:42:27,760
and so

858
00:42:26,160 --> 00:42:31,680
yeah so it's more like a dialogue

859
00:42:27,760 --> 00:42:34,079
partner and in the course um I provide

860
00:42:31,680 --> 00:42:37,440
the structure

861
00:42:34,079 --> 00:42:40,720
um so to not have this overwhelming

862
00:42:37,440 --> 00:42:44,880
feeling of oh everything goes

863
00:42:40,720 --> 00:42:48,000
um but okay um

864
00:42:44,880 --> 00:42:49,920
here you have your daily note section

865
00:42:48,000 --> 00:42:51,839
you can use that for fleeting notes.

866
00:42:49,920 --> 00:42:55,359
When you have an idea that pops into

867
00:42:51,839 --> 00:42:58,079
your hatch, just write it down. Um you

868
00:42:55,359 --> 00:43:01,280
can connect it with projects or

869
00:42:58,079 --> 00:43:05,200
questions you already tackling.

870
00:43:01,280 --> 00:43:09,280
Um so it comes with uh the preconfigured

871
00:43:05,200 --> 00:43:12,319
um vault with folders which are not

872
00:43:09,280 --> 00:43:16,960
topic folders um but are functional

873
00:43:12,319 --> 00:43:19,920
folders. Um it comes with a selection of

874
00:43:16,960 --> 00:43:24,400
tags which are useful. It comes with a

875
00:43:19,920 --> 00:43:27,359
selection of queries that allow you to

876
00:43:24,400 --> 00:43:29,040
present yourself open loops, open

877
00:43:27,359 --> 00:43:31,520
questions

878
00:43:29,040 --> 00:43:33,760
in the morning when you open Obsidian

879
00:43:31,520 --> 00:43:37,680
and you know, oh, I can continue working

880
00:43:33,760 --> 00:43:43,280
there. Um, but I don't think that any of

881
00:43:37,680 --> 00:43:48,800
that would be much of much use if you

882
00:43:43,280 --> 00:43:50,800
don't get the explanation um why the

883
00:43:48,800 --> 00:43:53,280
folders are there, why the tags are

884
00:43:50,800 --> 00:43:54,880
there, what the function is, how it

885
00:43:53,280 --> 00:44:00,400
interconnects.

886
00:43:54,880 --> 00:44:05,359
So I hope with the course to explain um

887
00:44:00,400 --> 00:44:09,200
how you can quickly build a habit a

888
00:44:05,359 --> 00:44:12,800
routine of daily writing

889
00:44:09,200 --> 00:44:16,000
into this structure and then adjust it

890
00:44:12,800 --> 00:44:18,640
to your needs. Um, and it seems like

891
00:44:16,000 --> 00:44:23,760
most people just go with the structure

892
00:44:18,640 --> 00:44:27,440
as it is and are able to use it for

893
00:44:23,760 --> 00:44:29,520
academic writing, but also for

894
00:44:27,440 --> 00:44:32,000
um

895
00:44:29,520 --> 00:44:36,000
more

896
00:44:32,000 --> 00:44:38,160
looking things up, um, keeping track of

897
00:44:36,000 --> 00:44:41,920
projects,

898
00:44:38,160 --> 00:44:44,800
um, and having information readily

899
00:44:41,920 --> 00:44:49,359
available. Um

900
00:44:44,800 --> 00:44:54,880
yeah, so I think it's a lot about um

901
00:44:49,359 --> 00:44:59,599
skipping this long process of

902
00:44:54,880 --> 00:45:03,359
figuring stuff out um trying to

903
00:44:59,599 --> 00:45:07,040
um conserve the advantages of the

904
00:45:03,359 --> 00:45:08,960
original set casten in digital form

905
00:45:07,040 --> 00:45:11,200
um

906
00:45:08,960 --> 00:45:14,160
that

907
00:45:11,200 --> 00:45:17,200
the students or users ers don't have to

908
00:45:14,160 --> 00:45:22,960
go through this long iteration process

909
00:45:17,200 --> 00:45:25,359
of um developing a structure that works

910
00:45:22,960 --> 00:45:29,359
not just in the beginning but in the

911
00:45:25,359 --> 00:45:32,160
long term. So I have thousand of notes.

912
00:45:29,359 --> 00:45:34,720
It's pretty complex.

913
00:45:32,160 --> 00:45:40,400
And

914
00:45:34,720 --> 00:45:43,359
some some things I only realized

915
00:45:40,400 --> 00:45:47,280
after I went through this threshold of

916
00:45:43,359 --> 00:45:50,000
10 or 20,000 individual notes where you

917
00:45:47,280 --> 00:45:52,079
realize, oh,

918
00:45:50,000 --> 00:45:57,200
you you need to deal with this

919
00:45:52,079 --> 00:45:59,119
complexity in a way. um that

920
00:45:57,200 --> 00:46:02,319
would have been so much easier if I knew

921
00:45:59,119 --> 00:46:06,079
that in the beginning. Um so I think

922
00:46:02,319 --> 00:46:12,359
that's that's what I hope to achieve

923
00:46:06,079 --> 00:46:12,359
with with this um with this course,

924
00:46:12,880 --> 00:46:17,920
>> right? And I think you've said before

925
00:46:15,760 --> 00:46:20,960
that the moment you stop treating notes

926
00:46:17,920 --> 00:46:23,680
as just storage and start seeing them as

927
00:46:20,960 --> 00:46:25,359
dialogue, your your thinking shifts. And

928
00:46:23,680 --> 00:46:27,680
I think that's that's the powerful

929
00:46:25,359 --> 00:46:30,560
component of uh having a system like

930
00:46:27,680 --> 00:46:32,720
this. It's not necessarily something for

931
00:46:30,560 --> 00:46:36,079
everybody. It's not necessarily

932
00:46:32,720 --> 00:46:38,240
something that's easy to to set up um or

933
00:46:36,079 --> 00:46:40,720
even maintain because it requires

934
00:46:38,240 --> 00:46:44,240
constant effort. You have to have a

935
00:46:40,720 --> 00:46:47,280
habit of regularly creating notes that

936
00:46:44,240 --> 00:46:50,079
are not just notes in terms of quantity

937
00:46:47,280 --> 00:46:52,560
but in in terms of quality and having

938
00:46:50,079 --> 00:46:55,119
some kind of sufficient method or

939
00:46:52,560 --> 00:46:57,760
routine where you are frequently using

940
00:46:55,119 --> 00:47:00,480
this system and that's the only way that

941
00:46:57,760 --> 00:47:03,119
your brain is going to trust this system

942
00:47:00,480 --> 00:47:06,240
to maintain a certain set of outside

943
00:47:03,119 --> 00:47:08,160
knowledge that you will be more likely

944
00:47:06,240 --> 00:47:10,720
to reference. because I've made the

945
00:47:08,160 --> 00:47:12,560
mistake of having say an Evernote system

946
00:47:10,720 --> 00:47:14,880
that I tried to build on Thiago

947
00:47:12,560 --> 00:47:17,839
Thiagoforte's par method. We have

948
00:47:14,880 --> 00:47:20,560
projects, areas, resources, archives and

949
00:47:17,839 --> 00:47:23,200
then I end up just forgetting that it's

950
00:47:20,560 --> 00:47:25,359
there. And my first default if I need

951
00:47:23,200 --> 00:47:28,160
information on a subject was to go to

952
00:47:25,359 --> 00:47:30,400
Google or now it's just to go and create

953
00:47:28,160 --> 00:47:33,599
like a a deep research query inside of

954
00:47:30,400 --> 00:47:36,160
chat GPT and I I haven't necessarily

955
00:47:33,599 --> 00:47:38,640
created a habit of let me look at my

956
00:47:36,160 --> 00:47:40,880
notes first and see what I've read

957
00:47:38,640 --> 00:47:43,440
previously, what thoughts I've created.

958
00:47:40,880 --> 00:47:46,160
It's so easy to just kind of have your

959
00:47:43,440 --> 00:47:48,800
thinking shift to extern externally

960
00:47:46,160 --> 00:47:50,640
looking for it instead of intrinsically

961
00:47:48,800 --> 00:47:51,920
seeing what you already have because

962
00:47:50,640 --> 00:47:53,359
there's a good chance that you're going

963
00:47:51,920 --> 00:47:56,160
to have some golden nuggets in there

964
00:47:53,359 --> 00:47:59,680
that you haven't thought of before.

965
00:47:56,160 --> 00:48:05,200
>> I totally agree. It's not for everyone.

966
00:47:59,680 --> 00:48:08,240
Um, I think anyone who expect to be as

967
00:48:05,200 --> 00:48:11,599
proficient as Lumen and suddenly start

968
00:48:08,240 --> 00:48:15,760
uh creating an output of a few articles

969
00:48:11,599 --> 00:48:18,760
a month um will be disappointed um

970
00:48:15,760 --> 00:48:18,760
because

971
00:48:18,880 --> 00:48:25,839
you still need to read,

972
00:48:22,800 --> 00:48:30,079
think, write

973
00:48:25,839 --> 00:48:32,960
and have the discipline to

974
00:48:30,079 --> 00:48:37,040
um

975
00:48:32,960 --> 00:48:40,160
have a routine of um practicing all

976
00:48:37,040 --> 00:48:44,079
these things.

977
00:48:40,160 --> 00:48:48,960
If you think and take thinking

978
00:48:44,079 --> 00:48:52,160
seriously, if you read things not just

979
00:48:48,960 --> 00:48:54,720
for the joy of reading but with the

980
00:48:52,160 --> 00:49:00,240
intention of using the information and

981
00:48:54,720 --> 00:49:02,880
using the ideas and challenges um a book

982
00:49:00,240 --> 00:49:05,200
or article provides

983
00:49:02,880 --> 00:49:08,640
to

984
00:49:05,200 --> 00:49:12,880
challenge your own thinking, your way of

985
00:49:08,640 --> 00:49:17,280
um looking at the world if if that is

986
00:49:12,880 --> 00:49:21,280
your goal, regardless of the output

987
00:49:17,280 --> 00:49:23,839
you're aiming for, I think

988
00:49:21,280 --> 00:49:26,400
it's a method that can work for all

989
00:49:23,839 --> 00:49:28,000
kinds of different people. Uh you don't

990
00:49:26,400 --> 00:49:32,480
have to be an academic. You don't have

991
00:49:28,000 --> 00:49:34,480
to um have the aim of writing. I think

992
00:49:32,480 --> 00:49:36,319
the

993
00:49:34,480 --> 00:49:40,240
common

994
00:49:36,319 --> 00:49:43,520
advantage is that it allows you to

995
00:49:40,240 --> 00:49:46,720
challenge your own thinking and it's so

996
00:49:43,520 --> 00:49:50,079
much easier to change your thinking when

997
00:49:46,720 --> 00:49:53,280
you have it externalized first. When you

998
00:49:50,079 --> 00:49:56,559
look at your thoughts in writing, it's

999
00:49:53,280 --> 00:50:00,160
so so much easier to detect the flaws in

1000
00:49:56,559 --> 00:50:03,040
that or contradictions between two

1001
00:50:00,160 --> 00:50:05,760
pieces of uh information you have

1002
00:50:03,040 --> 00:50:08,319
written down. You you just detect that

1003
00:50:05,760 --> 00:50:10,079
when you look at it. But it's if it's

1004
00:50:08,319 --> 00:50:12,559
only in your brain, if you read

1005
00:50:10,079 --> 00:50:14,480
something and you think, "Yeah, okay,

1006
00:50:12,559 --> 00:50:16,079
that's that's interesting." And then you

1007
00:50:14,480 --> 00:50:18,400
read the next bit and you think, "Yeah,

1008
00:50:16,079 --> 00:50:21,119
okay, that convinced me as well." you

1009
00:50:18,400 --> 00:50:26,319
don't even realize that these two things

1010
00:50:21,119 --> 00:50:29,200
don't fit together. So that that is what

1011
00:50:26,319 --> 00:50:30,640
it makes it interesting to me. I think

1012
00:50:29,200 --> 00:50:33,119
that's what makes it relevant for

1013
00:50:30,640 --> 00:50:37,200
writers because if you want to write

1014
00:50:33,119 --> 00:50:40,480
something original, you need to

1015
00:50:37,200 --> 00:50:43,760
come up with something new, interesting,

1016
00:50:40,480 --> 00:50:45,359
a new angle. You need to

1017
00:50:43,760 --> 00:50:48,319
um

1018
00:50:45,359 --> 00:50:50,640
let ideas

1019
00:50:48,319 --> 00:50:54,240
um

1020
00:50:50,640 --> 00:50:57,200
be enriched through your own experience.

1021
00:50:54,240 --> 00:51:01,119
Just taking something from CHP and

1022
00:50:57,200 --> 00:51:03,359
putting it on paper. Um people will see

1023
00:51:01,119 --> 00:51:05,359
that it is not enriched by your

1024
00:51:03,359 --> 00:51:08,400
experience. There is a difference

1025
00:51:05,359 --> 00:51:13,440
between here's a piece of information. I

1026
00:51:08,400 --> 00:51:16,319
know this is true and that is true and

1027
00:51:13,440 --> 00:51:19,359
being able to express the relevance of

1028
00:51:16,319 --> 00:51:22,319
something and that needs a human

1029
00:51:19,359 --> 00:51:26,640
intervention and the settle casten

1030
00:51:22,319 --> 00:51:29,599
expands this personal space and uses the

1031
00:51:26,640 --> 00:51:31,520
advantage of externalization

1032
00:51:29,599 --> 00:51:35,599
to

1033
00:51:31,520 --> 00:51:38,400
modify to develop and in in a way to

1034
00:51:35,599 --> 00:51:42,240
mature your own thinking.

1035
00:51:38,400 --> 00:51:46,480
Um, so I agree it's not for everyone,

1036
00:51:42,240 --> 00:51:48,319
but I also think it's it doesn't need to

1037
00:51:46,480 --> 00:51:52,800
be this

1038
00:51:48,319 --> 00:51:57,760
academic tool that needs attention all

1039
00:51:52,800 --> 00:52:00,160
the time. For me actually um that might

1040
00:51:57,760 --> 00:52:02,880
surprise you. There are long streaks

1041
00:52:00,160 --> 00:52:06,800
where I don't open my settle custom at

1042
00:52:02,880 --> 00:52:13,040
all. Um because I'm in the middle of

1043
00:52:06,800 --> 00:52:15,119
finishing the online course and have um

1044
00:52:13,040 --> 00:52:20,000
organizational things to do. I need to

1045
00:52:15,119 --> 00:52:22,960
call people. I I go on podcast. Um

1046
00:52:20,000 --> 00:52:25,359
so it's on the back burner. I I'm I

1047
00:52:22,960 --> 00:52:27,040
didn't start this day with opening my

1048
00:52:25,359 --> 00:52:29,520
subtle custom. Now actually I did

1049
00:52:27,040 --> 00:52:33,680
because I for preparation of the podcast

1050
00:52:29,520 --> 00:52:36,240
I I I of course looked into it. Um but

1051
00:52:33,680 --> 00:52:39,839
but there are long periods where I don't

1052
00:52:36,240 --> 00:52:42,640
look at it and

1053
00:52:39,839 --> 00:52:47,760
at the same time whenever I have a

1054
00:52:42,640 --> 00:52:50,480
sudden idea and I think that's relevant.

1055
00:52:47,760 --> 00:52:54,960
I I wouldn't know where to put it if not

1056
00:52:50,480 --> 00:52:57,599
into my telecast. Um, if I just put it

1057
00:52:54,960 --> 00:53:01,680
somewhere on paper, it it would be lost.

1058
00:52:57,599 --> 00:53:03,920
Um, it can be an in between step, but I

1059
00:53:01,680 --> 00:53:06,800
need to know it goes there, but because

1060
00:53:03,920 --> 00:53:10,000
that's the only place where it can make

1061
00:53:06,800 --> 00:53:13,599
an actual difference. Um, so it allows

1062
00:53:10,000 --> 00:53:19,319
me to pick up um where I left it, even

1063
00:53:13,599 --> 00:53:19,319
if I left it a couple of weeks ago. Um,

1064
00:53:19,599 --> 00:53:26,960
I don't know if routine is overrated.

1065
00:53:22,720 --> 00:53:29,680
Um, to me, having a daily routine is

1066
00:53:26,960 --> 00:53:32,960
often something I

1067
00:53:29,680 --> 00:53:35,599
I I really like the idea of, but in

1068
00:53:32,960 --> 00:53:38,640
reality, it it it often doesn't work.

1069
00:53:35,599 --> 00:53:41,359
I'm I'm I'm on the train and can't have

1070
00:53:38,640 --> 00:53:42,960
only my morning routine at my desk.

1071
00:53:41,359 --> 00:53:45,599
sometimes

1072
00:53:42,960 --> 00:53:51,520
uh it's too noisy at home and I'm at the

1073
00:53:45,599 --> 00:53:55,440
office. Um so in in reality

1074
00:53:51,520 --> 00:53:58,960
in my life at least I I don't have such

1075
00:53:55,440 --> 00:54:03,440
a daily routine uh even though it it

1076
00:53:58,960 --> 00:54:05,920
always sounds great. Um but I'm glad I

1077
00:54:03,440 --> 00:54:08,319
have a system which provides me with a

1078
00:54:05,920 --> 00:54:12,559
kind of structure that allows me to pick

1079
00:54:08,319 --> 00:54:16,880
up um where I left it. um continue to

1080
00:54:12,559 --> 00:54:20,079
work with a project and sometimes leave

1081
00:54:16,880 --> 00:54:22,640
a project for a while, develop another

1082
00:54:20,079 --> 00:54:26,800
one further because

1083
00:54:22,640 --> 00:54:29,359
I'm easily bored and um want to switch,

1084
00:54:26,800 --> 00:54:32,640
which is maybe a reason a lot of people

1085
00:54:29,359 --> 00:54:35,440
with ADHD um seem to like the system a

1086
00:54:32,640 --> 00:54:39,680
lot. Um

1087
00:54:35,440 --> 00:54:41,520
but yeah, that's um the long answer to

1088
00:54:39,680 --> 00:54:45,760
um

1089
00:54:41,520 --> 00:54:49,480
to to the problem of um who's it for and

1090
00:54:45,760 --> 00:54:49,480
who's it not for.

1091
00:54:49,599 --> 00:54:54,480
>> Yeah. And perhaps having a routine isn't

1092
00:54:51,680 --> 00:54:57,599
necessary as long as you have the the

1093
00:54:54,480 --> 00:55:00,000
instinct to open up the app and say add

1094
00:54:57,599 --> 00:55:02,240
the relevant information whenever you

1095
00:55:00,000 --> 00:55:04,480
come across the idea or the note or the

1096
00:55:02,240 --> 00:55:06,960
highlight as quote and that you think is

1097
00:55:04,480 --> 00:55:09,200
relevant to your system. So it's the act

1098
00:55:06,960 --> 00:55:11,520
of maintaining the system and then

1099
00:55:09,200 --> 00:55:13,119
utilizing it when you need to in

1100
00:55:11,520 --> 00:55:14,880
relation to the work that you're trying

1101
00:55:13,119 --> 00:55:16,480
to accomplish. And I think that's the

1102
00:55:14,880 --> 00:55:18,240
only thing that matters as long as

1103
00:55:16,480 --> 00:55:19,520
you're not just consistently adding

1104
00:55:18,240 --> 00:55:21,200
information to it and then not

1105
00:55:19,520 --> 00:55:23,520
referencing it or not using it because

1106
00:55:21,200 --> 00:55:25,119
then you're just creating a a bloated

1107
00:55:23,520 --> 00:55:27,680
system that you're unlikely to

1108
00:55:25,119 --> 00:55:30,559
necessarily use. But but we've mentioned

1109
00:55:27,680 --> 00:55:32,559
chat GPT now a few times and now it's

1110
00:55:30,559 --> 00:55:35,760
become very widespread different forms

1111
00:55:32,559 --> 00:55:37,839
of AI Gemini Claude and I'm wondering

1112
00:55:35,760 --> 00:55:40,000
what your thoughts are on the matter in

1113
00:55:37,839 --> 00:55:41,599
terms of do you think it could take over

1114
00:55:40,000 --> 00:55:43,599
manual note-taking? Do you think that

1115
00:55:41,599 --> 00:55:46,720
could become obsolete? Have you seen

1116
00:55:43,599 --> 00:55:49,280
your students kind of using AI and do

1117
00:55:46,720 --> 00:55:51,839
you think it's something that that could

1118
00:55:49,280 --> 00:55:53,520
replace the Zeno castle system or do you

1119
00:55:51,839 --> 00:55:57,280
think it might complement it?

1120
00:55:53,520 --> 00:56:00,960
>> At the moment we treat chat chipity or

1121
00:55:57,280 --> 00:56:04,960
uh AI um

1122
00:56:00,960 --> 00:56:09,680
in a way that's too external

1123
00:56:04,960 --> 00:56:12,960
and too internal at the same time. So I

1124
00:56:09,680 --> 00:56:15,040
think our thinking is

1125
00:56:12,960 --> 00:56:18,880
still

1126
00:56:15,040 --> 00:56:21,119
very much tied to what philosophers call

1127
00:56:18,880 --> 00:56:25,920
the representational

1128
00:56:21,119 --> 00:56:29,119
area where we think of the brain um as

1129
00:56:25,920 --> 00:56:32,480
an entity that is

1130
00:56:29,119 --> 00:56:35,200
um separate from the world.

1131
00:56:32,480 --> 00:56:37,520
It's like a processor that uh deals with

1132
00:56:35,200 --> 00:56:40,480
the information coming in and then

1133
00:56:37,520 --> 00:56:46,680
information goes out again. And only

1134
00:56:40,480 --> 00:56:46,680
recently we start understanding the

1135
00:56:47,119 --> 00:56:53,839
impact a different kind of thinking

1136
00:56:50,160 --> 00:56:57,760
about thinking can have on practical

1137
00:56:53,839 --> 00:57:01,359
matters. So if we think about thinking

1138
00:56:57,760 --> 00:57:05,359
as something that happens externally as

1139
00:57:01,359 --> 00:57:10,400
well as internally that we really think

1140
00:57:05,359 --> 00:57:13,400
within our environment with our tools

1141
00:57:10,400 --> 00:57:13,400
we

1142
00:57:13,920 --> 00:57:21,920
I think shift the whole discussion. Um,

1143
00:57:19,920 --> 00:57:27,599
if you think we only think with our

1144
00:57:21,920 --> 00:57:30,799
brains, um, you tend to see AI as a

1145
00:57:27,599 --> 00:57:32,400
replacement of our thinking process. We,

1146
00:57:30,799 --> 00:57:37,119
um,

1147
00:57:32,400 --> 00:57:40,000
use AI to think for us instead.

1148
00:57:37,119 --> 00:57:43,920
And that's obviously a risk. And if you

1149
00:57:40,000 --> 00:57:46,640
think like that, you do that. You stop

1150
00:57:43,920 --> 00:57:49,640
thinking for yourself. you let AI do the

1151
00:57:46,640 --> 00:57:49,640
work.

1152
00:57:50,000 --> 00:57:55,599
But if you think

1153
00:57:52,319 --> 00:57:59,760
that thinking happens in an external

1154
00:57:55,599 --> 00:58:03,400
space and you want to

1155
00:57:59,760 --> 00:58:03,400
keep the

1156
00:58:03,599 --> 00:58:08,160
critical approach to the information

1157
00:58:05,440 --> 00:58:11,680
you're dealing with, if you want to keep

1158
00:58:08,160 --> 00:58:14,400
the experience enriched thinking that

1159
00:58:11,680 --> 00:58:19,200
makes any output

1160
00:58:14,400 --> 00:58:23,040
uh interesting for other humans, if you

1161
00:58:19,200 --> 00:58:27,920
want to develop your own thinking

1162
00:58:23,040 --> 00:58:31,760
skills, your own thinking abilities.

1163
00:58:27,920 --> 00:58:34,640
Then it becomes all about

1164
00:58:31,760 --> 00:58:36,880
the creation of an environment

1165
00:58:34,640 --> 00:58:40,640
that is personal

1166
00:58:36,880 --> 00:58:43,200
but also external because only in an

1167
00:58:40,640 --> 00:58:46,720
external space you can build up

1168
00:58:43,200 --> 00:58:48,559
complexity. You can combine more than a

1169
00:58:46,720 --> 00:58:54,720
few things.

1170
00:58:48,559 --> 00:58:59,359
Um, so AI makes it in my opinion obvious

1171
00:58:54,720 --> 00:59:02,000
that we need to create external personal

1172
00:58:59,359 --> 00:59:05,680
thinking spaces.

1173
00:59:02,000 --> 00:59:11,920
Even more than that, I hope that we

1174
00:59:05,680 --> 00:59:17,680
shift the discussion um more towards

1175
00:59:11,920 --> 00:59:22,799
the the question of how can we curate

1176
00:59:17,680 --> 00:59:26,160
common spaces to think together in like

1177
00:59:22,799 --> 00:59:31,280
a third place between the big

1178
00:59:26,160 --> 00:59:35,520
information out there that can be

1179
00:59:31,280 --> 00:59:40,240
um quickly searched and

1180
00:59:35,520 --> 00:59:43,280
presented by AI and our own little tiny

1181
00:59:40,240 --> 00:59:49,280
minds uh that have to deal with that. I

1182
00:59:43,280 --> 00:59:52,319
think these third spaces will be where

1183
00:59:49,280 --> 00:59:54,480
we make the dis. How we curate them, how

1184
00:59:52,319 --> 01:00:00,079
we build them, how we think about them

1185
00:59:54,480 --> 01:00:03,839
will be the space will be the question

1186
01:00:00,079 --> 01:00:07,760
on how we deal with AR like with every

1187
01:00:03,839 --> 01:00:11,359
other kind of information overload um we

1188
01:00:07,760 --> 01:00:14,400
face at the moment. And the question,

1189
01:00:11,359 --> 01:00:17,280
well, will it replace our thinking or

1190
01:00:14,400 --> 01:00:21,280
will it um

1191
01:00:17,280 --> 01:00:24,559
um increase our ability?

1192
01:00:21,280 --> 01:00:27,599
It really depends on how we build these

1193
01:00:24,559 --> 01:00:30,599
third spaces. That that's my point of

1194
01:00:27,599 --> 01:00:30,599
view.

1195
01:00:31,359 --> 01:00:38,160
>> Perhaps a a a way of viewing it is that

1196
01:00:35,280 --> 01:00:40,000
AI itself kind of streamlines research.

1197
01:00:38,160 --> 01:00:41,920
you know, we can ask it any questions we

1198
01:00:40,000 --> 01:00:44,000
want. Uh we can do a deep research

1199
01:00:41,920 --> 01:00:46,000
inquiry and then have all of the the

1200
01:00:44,000 --> 01:00:48,640
current information on a specific

1201
01:00:46,000 --> 01:00:52,480
subject subject. Whether or not it's

1202
01:00:48,640 --> 01:00:54,720
100% accurate, it kind of varies, but AI

1203
01:00:52,480 --> 01:00:56,880
will never replace deep personal

1204
01:00:54,720 --> 01:00:59,440
thought. Now, we can use it as an

1205
01:00:56,880 --> 01:01:02,240
external reference to bounce our ideas

1206
01:00:59,440 --> 01:01:05,280
off. But more often than not, the way

1207
01:01:02,240 --> 01:01:08,640
that you phrase your question to an AI,

1208
01:01:05,280 --> 01:01:11,040
it's going to intuitit your underlying

1209
01:01:08,640 --> 01:01:13,520
thinking, your underlying reasoning, the

1210
01:01:11,040 --> 01:01:15,760
underlying perspective of what you want.

1211
01:01:13,520 --> 01:01:18,480
And that's now why we have situations

1212
01:01:15,760 --> 01:01:22,000
where we have people who are going into

1213
01:01:18,480 --> 01:01:24,240
delusional fantasies because their AI

1214
01:01:22,000 --> 01:01:27,359
believes it's God and they are its

1215
01:01:24,240 --> 01:01:30,319
worshipper. And open AI itself has had

1216
01:01:27,359 --> 01:01:33,440
to employ now psychologists uh

1217
01:01:30,319 --> 01:01:35,839
psychotherapists to try to understand

1218
01:01:33,440 --> 01:01:39,839
why is this happening because it seems

1219
01:01:35,839 --> 01:01:43,359
that if you have a certain level of of

1220
01:01:39,839 --> 01:01:46,559
emotional or a kind of a disorder of

1221
01:01:43,359 --> 01:01:50,559
sorts mental health issue that you could

1222
01:01:46,559 --> 01:01:54,160
be subject to what AI uh the delusions

1223
01:01:50,559 --> 01:01:57,680
that AI itself can go down and so if it

1224
01:01:54,160 --> 01:01:59,280
can't place deep personal thought that

1225
01:01:57,680 --> 01:02:01,119
is more or less kind of critical

1226
01:01:59,280 --> 01:02:03,520
thinking skills. So, I think the next

1227
01:02:01,119 --> 01:02:05,760
question to ask is, well, why are

1228
01:02:03,520 --> 01:02:08,640
critical thinking skills important if

1229
01:02:05,760 --> 01:02:10,559
we're in an era with AI that can just

1230
01:02:08,640 --> 01:02:13,040
answer all of our questions and do all

1231
01:02:10,559 --> 01:02:16,160
of our thinking? And I think my I would

1232
01:02:13,040 --> 01:02:18,319
default to now this idea of of prompt

1233
01:02:16,160 --> 01:02:20,960
engineering or it's more recently been

1234
01:02:18,319 --> 01:02:22,640
referred to now as context engineering

1235
01:02:20,960 --> 01:02:24,880
because there's a lot more than just

1236
01:02:22,640 --> 01:02:27,440
trying to figure out how you create the

1237
01:02:24,880 --> 01:02:30,480
best prompt because now we have AI

1238
01:02:27,440 --> 01:02:32,799
agents that are doing complex workflows

1239
01:02:30,480 --> 01:02:35,280
and you really have to be able to think

1240
01:02:32,799 --> 01:02:38,160
about how is this workflow going to to

1241
01:02:35,280 --> 01:02:40,880
work and if you're employed at a job and

1242
01:02:38,160 --> 01:02:42,720
especially now millennials or Gen Z's

1243
01:02:40,880 --> 01:02:45,119
especially the Gen Z generation are

1244
01:02:42,720 --> 01:02:47,680
having a very tough time graduating from

1245
01:02:45,119 --> 01:02:50,400
college and getting a job because all of

1246
01:02:47,680 --> 01:02:53,359
the low-level jobs are now easily being

1247
01:02:50,400 --> 01:02:55,599
able to being taken over by AI. But if

1248
01:02:53,359 --> 01:02:59,119
you have the ability to do context

1249
01:02:55,599 --> 01:03:02,880
engineering to think about why is how do

1250
01:02:59,119 --> 01:03:05,520
I make AI work best in this use case or

1251
01:03:02,880 --> 01:03:06,960
if you have uh trauma or mental health

1252
01:03:05,520 --> 01:03:09,920
issues and you're wanting to use Chad

1253
01:03:06,960 --> 01:03:12,480
GPT as a therapist, how do I best phrase

1254
01:03:09,920 --> 01:03:14,079
my conversation in a way where it's not

1255
01:03:12,480 --> 01:03:16,799
going to lead me down a delusional

1256
01:03:14,079 --> 01:03:19,280
fantasy? Because it's how you talk to an

1257
01:03:16,799 --> 01:03:21,760
AI. And I'm sure we've all used AI in a

1258
01:03:19,280 --> 01:03:24,799
way where you ask it something and it

1259
01:03:21,760 --> 01:03:26,480
gives you a response, but then you but

1260
01:03:24,799 --> 01:03:28,640
then you realize, wait, it doesn't have

1261
01:03:26,480 --> 01:03:30,799
this additional context. It's missing

1262
01:03:28,640 --> 01:03:32,480
something or I don't feel like it's

1263
01:03:30,799 --> 01:03:34,559
quite right. And then you respond to it

1264
01:03:32,480 --> 01:03:36,400
and you say, oh, what about this? And

1265
01:03:34,559 --> 01:03:38,799
then it's like, oh yes, sir, you are

1266
01:03:36,400 --> 01:03:41,680
brilliant. This is and it completely

1267
01:03:38,799 --> 01:03:43,280
changes its answer. And so I think all

1268
01:03:41,680 --> 01:03:46,960
of this comes back down to what I'm

1269
01:03:43,280 --> 01:03:49,599
saying is a encompass is that AI can

1270
01:03:46,960 --> 01:03:52,240
help us in our our journey for

1271
01:03:49,599 --> 01:03:55,039
accomplishing for building for for even

1272
01:03:52,240 --> 01:03:57,760
thinking but I think it's a tool just

1273
01:03:55,039 --> 01:03:59,920
like everything else and the moment you

1274
01:03:57,760 --> 01:04:03,200
start to see AI as something that is

1275
01:03:59,920 --> 01:04:05,520
going to replace your need for thinking

1276
01:04:03,200 --> 01:04:07,839
for writing for creative thought then

1277
01:04:05,520 --> 01:04:09,599
you're going down a dark path because

1278
01:04:07,839 --> 01:04:10,400
that could just lead to a delusional

1279
01:04:09,599 --> 01:04:12,559
fantasy.

1280
01:04:10,400 --> 01:04:14,960
where you're just kind of not creating

1281
01:04:12,559 --> 01:04:17,359
anything new and who knows where that

1282
01:04:14,960 --> 01:04:20,079
might end up. So I think now more than

1283
01:04:17,359 --> 01:04:22,720
ever we need to emphasize the importance

1284
01:04:20,079 --> 01:04:25,440
of critical thinking because that is how

1285
01:04:22,720 --> 01:04:27,760
you're going to leverage AI to allow you

1286
01:04:25,440 --> 01:04:30,400
to get a job to allow you to get ahead

1287
01:04:27,760 --> 01:04:32,640
of everybody else who is not able to

1288
01:04:30,400 --> 01:04:35,280
leverage the ability to think properly

1289
01:04:32,640 --> 01:04:38,000
and then apply that to AI.

1290
01:04:35,280 --> 01:04:43,039
>> So that's that's my my two cents. Yeah,

1291
01:04:38,000 --> 01:04:46,359
I I totally agree that the way we use it

1292
01:04:43,039 --> 01:04:46,359
is is

1293
01:04:46,559 --> 01:04:53,119
crucial and that

1294
01:04:49,760 --> 01:04:55,599
there is a way to use it like a machine

1295
01:04:53,119 --> 01:04:58,000
that replaces your thinking like like a

1296
01:04:55,599 --> 01:05:01,440
bicycle you drive to work with instead

1297
01:04:58,000 --> 01:05:03,599
of walking. So you can just roll and

1298
01:05:01,440 --> 01:05:06,799
don't have to put any effort into it.

1299
01:05:03,599 --> 01:05:10,480
But you can use the bicycle as well to

1300
01:05:06,799 --> 01:05:15,599
increase your range to discover new

1301
01:05:10,480 --> 01:05:20,079
places or to train your muscles and um

1302
01:05:15,599 --> 01:05:23,359
to enhance what you have. Um so

1303
01:05:20,079 --> 01:05:26,079
certainly it's about how to use it. Um

1304
01:05:23,359 --> 01:05:27,599
so there will be certainly

1305
01:05:26,079 --> 01:05:31,839
curated

1306
01:05:27,599 --> 01:05:34,240
environments um as you describe them.

1307
01:05:31,839 --> 01:05:38,480
Some that are

1308
01:05:34,240 --> 01:05:43,680
fit for mental health counseling and

1309
01:05:38,480 --> 01:05:47,599
some that are fit for um research and

1310
01:05:43,680 --> 01:05:49,839
pushing research. You know that to

1311
01:05:47,599 --> 01:05:51,599
change your way of thinking about the

1312
01:05:49,839 --> 01:05:53,440
world requires more than one piece of

1313
01:05:51,599 --> 01:05:55,920
information. But you need to take a lot

1314
01:05:53,440 --> 01:06:01,359
of pieces of information into account.

1315
01:05:55,920 --> 01:06:03,119
You need some kind of some form of

1316
01:06:01,359 --> 01:06:04,880
complexity.

1317
01:06:03,119 --> 01:06:08,240
Um

1318
01:06:04,880 --> 01:06:12,079
it's not mind-blowing. It's not oh wow

1319
01:06:08,240 --> 01:06:13,920
my worldview changed in an instant. It's

1320
01:06:12,079 --> 01:06:17,680
more mundane.

1321
01:06:13,920 --> 01:06:20,319
that probably that is the kind of buffer

1322
01:06:17,680 --> 01:06:25,280
we need to

1323
01:06:20,319 --> 01:06:27,119
um deal with the information coming in.

1324
01:06:25,280 --> 01:06:30,079
>> When I say critical thinking, I suppose

1325
01:06:27,119 --> 01:06:31,920
it's like uh the the ability to stop and

1326
01:06:30,079 --> 01:06:34,000
pause and question

1327
01:06:31,920 --> 01:06:37,359
>> a particular thought, right? Instead of

1328
01:06:34,000 --> 01:06:39,760
just accepting what external information

1329
01:06:37,359 --> 01:06:43,039
says or what somebody else or something

1330
01:06:39,760 --> 01:06:45,920
says about that. And we we tend now to

1331
01:06:43,039 --> 01:06:47,680
default to uh just asking AI for

1332
01:06:45,920 --> 01:06:50,400
everything and then just accepting

1333
01:06:47,680 --> 01:06:52,079
outright what it says without thinking

1334
01:06:50,400 --> 01:06:54,319
about what it's actually saying, just

1335
01:06:52,079 --> 01:06:55,680
accepting that information. And you

1336
01:06:54,319 --> 01:06:57,680
know, if we're in a world we're just

1337
01:06:55,680 --> 01:06:59,119
accepting information from an AI, it

1338
01:06:57,680 --> 01:07:00,720
might not always be correct. And it's

1339
01:06:59,119 --> 01:07:03,119
been shown it's definitely not always

1340
01:07:00,720 --> 01:07:06,160
correct. Um and so that can lead us down

1341
01:07:03,119 --> 01:07:09,039
like wrong paths. But I I suppose a a

1342
01:07:06,160 --> 01:07:12,079
perspective of utilizing AI in relation

1343
01:07:09,039 --> 01:07:14,240
to zetocasten is that perhaps it's it

1344
01:07:12,079 --> 01:07:16,720
can be good for summarizing. I don't

1345
01:07:14,240 --> 01:07:19,359
know. I I assume that Obsidian hasn't

1346
01:07:16,720 --> 01:07:21,520
implemented any AI functionality, but I

1347
01:07:19,359 --> 01:07:23,839
assume if they did, it would be helpful

1348
01:07:21,520 --> 01:07:25,920
because it's like everything else where

1349
01:07:23,839 --> 01:07:28,799
you can build out say like like the

1350
01:07:25,920 --> 01:07:30,240
Google uh forgot the the Google podcast.

1351
01:07:28,799 --> 01:07:32,960
I'm forgetting the the name of that

1352
01:07:30,240 --> 01:07:35,599
where you can upload PDFs of information

1353
01:07:32,960 --> 01:07:38,480
and then generate a podcast that will

1354
01:07:35,599 --> 01:07:41,440
kind of summarize the information in of

1355
01:07:38,480 --> 01:07:42,960
what you've up told it to to specify. So

1356
01:07:41,440 --> 01:07:46,000
perhaps I think there could be a benefit

1357
01:07:42,960 --> 01:07:49,200
in utilizing AI for that. But overall it

1358
01:07:46,000 --> 01:07:53,599
still is that there's a risk of being

1359
01:07:49,200 --> 01:07:56,000
overrelyant on AI as a means of of

1360
01:07:53,599 --> 01:07:58,880
externalizing your thinking because we

1361
01:07:56,000 --> 01:08:02,319
it's still today just as prevalent many

1362
01:07:58,880 --> 01:08:06,079
years after it became popular that the

1363
01:08:02,319 --> 01:08:09,280
ability to create a a good prompt is

1364
01:08:06,079 --> 01:08:11,920
directly proportional to the quality of

1365
01:08:09,280 --> 01:08:14,319
the response you're going to get. And if

1366
01:08:11,920 --> 01:08:17,679
you have a zettocast and network or a

1367
01:08:14,319 --> 01:08:20,560
system where you are able to see all of

1368
01:08:17,679 --> 01:08:23,120
these ideas and thoughts and intercon

1369
01:08:20,560 --> 01:08:26,080
the interconnectedness of them is going

1370
01:08:23,120 --> 01:08:28,799
to give you a different perspective when

1371
01:08:26,080 --> 01:08:31,040
you ask that question to AI that is

1372
01:08:28,799 --> 01:08:33,600
going to generate a a proportionally

1373
01:08:31,040 --> 01:08:36,159
much better response than if you had not

1374
01:08:33,600 --> 01:08:39,120
had a system in which you were able to

1375
01:08:36,159 --> 01:08:41,600
see all of the connectedness between

1376
01:08:39,120 --> 01:08:43,839
various thoughts and ideas. the idea of

1377
01:08:41,600 --> 01:08:47,199
critical thinking as stopping,

1378
01:08:43,839 --> 01:08:53,839
reflecting, and taking the time to look

1379
01:08:47,199 --> 01:08:58,000
at something. And it is connected to

1380
01:08:53,839 --> 01:09:00,319
something that is often overlooked. Um,

1381
01:08:58,000 --> 01:09:03,120
reflection is not just about judging

1382
01:09:00,319 --> 01:09:07,120
information coming in. It's also about

1383
01:09:03,120 --> 01:09:11,759
challenging the way we look at the world

1384
01:09:07,120 --> 01:09:14,159
and to change and develop mature in our

1385
01:09:11,759 --> 01:09:19,199
way of looking at the world and enrich

1386
01:09:14,159 --> 01:09:22,080
it with experience. So being able to

1387
01:09:19,199 --> 01:09:25,600
realize that the prompt you use is

1388
01:09:22,080 --> 01:09:29,199
probably not the best one um but that

1389
01:09:25,600 --> 01:09:31,199
you have to add context to it to get a

1390
01:09:29,199 --> 01:09:36,000
better response.

1391
01:09:31,199 --> 01:09:39,120
Um is only possible if

1392
01:09:36,000 --> 01:09:44,719
something on your side on the personal

1393
01:09:39,120 --> 01:09:49,440
side has developed over time. Um maybe

1394
01:09:44,719 --> 01:09:52,640
we look too much at judging information

1395
01:09:49,440 --> 01:09:57,679
coming in and too little about

1396
01:09:52,640 --> 01:09:59,199
developing our ability to deal with the

1397
01:09:57,679 --> 01:10:04,239
information.

1398
01:09:59,199 --> 01:10:07,120
Um so not just about um

1399
01:10:04,239 --> 01:10:10,320
not trusting what's coming in but also

1400
01:10:07,120 --> 01:10:13,280
being worried that oneself needs um

1401
01:10:10,320 --> 01:10:17,520
maybe a little bit more development to

1402
01:10:13,280 --> 01:10:20,400
handle uh the information and

1403
01:10:17,520 --> 01:10:22,080
being open to have your mind changed by

1404
01:10:20,400 --> 01:10:26,239
it.

1405
01:10:22,080 --> 01:10:28,880
>> Yeah. And in an area in in in which we

1406
01:10:26,239 --> 01:10:30,880
in an area in which AI is a part of our

1407
01:10:28,880 --> 01:10:32,960
daily lives, I think it's now important

1408
01:10:30,880 --> 01:10:34,719
more important than ever to have a

1409
01:10:32,960 --> 01:10:37,360
system where you're able to collect

1410
01:10:34,719 --> 01:10:40,560
information because that will be useful

1411
01:10:37,360 --> 01:10:43,199
in helping set you apart from everybody

1412
01:10:40,560 --> 01:10:45,520
else who's able to use this tool but

1413
01:10:43,199 --> 01:10:47,520
using it in a much more generic capacity

1414
01:10:45,520 --> 01:10:49,520
without the level of insights that you

1415
01:10:47,520 --> 01:10:51,760
might otherwise gain by being able to

1416
01:10:49,520 --> 01:10:53,760
maintain your own personal note-taking

1417
01:10:51,760 --> 01:10:56,320
system. I think we've seen people like

1418
01:10:53,760 --> 01:10:58,400
like Ryan Holidayiday, David Pell,

1419
01:10:56,320 --> 01:11:00,480
Thiago Forte, all very prominent figures

1420
01:10:58,400 --> 01:11:03,840
in the self-help space who've either

1421
01:11:00,480 --> 01:11:06,800
developed a variety of books or systems

1422
01:11:03,840 --> 01:11:09,199
based on the Zenoccasten system. So, I

1423
01:11:06,800 --> 01:11:11,120
think it it's something that it as

1424
01:11:09,199 --> 01:11:12,640
people who have have used it, they

1425
01:11:11,120 --> 01:11:16,000
they've cited, you know, it helps them

1426
01:11:12,640 --> 01:11:18,480
to think more clearly. It helps with uh

1427
01:11:16,000 --> 01:11:20,480
idea retention. uh and you're able to

1428
01:11:18,480 --> 01:11:23,760
just get overall kind of more creative

1429
01:11:20,480 --> 01:11:26,239
insights from uh areas of work in which

1430
01:11:23,760 --> 01:11:28,560
you might not be able to to create or

1431
01:11:26,239 --> 01:11:30,800
gain these insights if you had not had

1432
01:11:28,560 --> 01:11:33,120
such a system. So I think it's something

1433
01:11:30,800 --> 01:11:36,239
that everybody whether you're a business

1434
01:11:33,120 --> 01:11:38,719
consultant or a writer or a student uh

1435
01:11:36,239 --> 01:11:40,880
everybody should really consider having

1436
01:11:38,719 --> 01:11:43,040
um to to some extent because that's

1437
01:11:40,880 --> 01:11:45,520
going to be one of the small things that

1438
01:11:43,040 --> 01:11:47,920
will help set you apart going into a

1439
01:11:45,520 --> 01:11:51,280
world in which AI is just prevalent

1440
01:11:47,920 --> 01:11:53,920
everywhere we go.

1441
01:11:51,280 --> 01:11:57,199
>> Yeah. I think the question of how can

1442
01:11:53,920 --> 01:11:59,120
you distinguish yourself if everyone can

1443
01:11:57,199 --> 01:12:01,520
um access

1444
01:11:59,120 --> 01:12:04,080
the the huge pool of information out

1445
01:12:01,520 --> 01:12:08,320
there. Um

1446
01:12:04,080 --> 01:12:10,880
certainly calls for a curated personal

1447
01:12:08,320 --> 01:12:13,440
thinking space. Yeah, you're right

1448
01:12:10,880 --> 01:12:15,600
there.

1449
01:12:13,440 --> 01:12:18,159
>> And so I I I know that you're working on

1450
01:12:15,600 --> 01:12:19,679
a new book and I think you started to

1451
01:12:18,159 --> 01:12:21,679
scale back and kind of individual

1452
01:12:19,679 --> 01:12:24,000
coaching. wondering if you can offer any

1453
01:12:21,679 --> 01:12:24,560
kind of insight into your your next

1454
01:12:24,000 --> 01:12:27,920
project.

1455
01:12:24,560 --> 01:12:31,280
>> Um, it's still in in development. Uh, I

1456
01:12:27,920 --> 01:12:33,600
kind of pick up on my academic work, um,

1457
01:12:31,280 --> 01:12:37,280
which is a little bit more about

1458
01:12:33,600 --> 01:12:40,719
epistemology, but I hope to make a

1459
01:12:37,280 --> 01:12:45,520
contribution to what almost seems like

1460
01:12:40,719 --> 01:12:49,520
an epistemic crisis at the moment. um

1461
01:12:45,520 --> 01:12:53,600
dealing with um a lot of disinformation

1462
01:12:49,520 --> 01:12:56,560
and how to be able to

1463
01:12:53,600 --> 01:13:02,159
um

1464
01:12:56,560 --> 01:13:05,040
deal with that or um set yourself up to

1465
01:13:02,159 --> 01:13:08,320
problematic um

1466
01:13:05,040 --> 01:13:11,199
uh information environment. And I think

1467
01:13:08,320 --> 01:13:16,000
it will have a lot to do with curating

1468
01:13:11,199 --> 01:13:19,920
these kinds of shared spaces and how to

1469
01:13:16,000 --> 01:13:21,520
think about shared thinking spaces.

1470
01:13:19,920 --> 01:13:23,120
Um

1471
01:13:21,520 --> 01:13:28,159
yeah, I would like to make a

1472
01:13:23,120 --> 01:13:32,360
contribution um to that solution. Um but

1473
01:13:28,159 --> 01:13:32,360
it might take a little bit more time.

1474
01:13:32,480 --> 01:13:38,719
And and I I can only hope that teaching

1475
01:13:35,679 --> 01:13:41,199
kind of notetaking as like a score as a

1476
01:13:38,719 --> 01:13:44,159
as a core skill alongside writing and

1477
01:13:41,199 --> 01:13:46,560
math could hopefully become part of our

1478
01:13:44,159 --> 01:13:48,719
future and education. I can we can only

1479
01:13:46,560 --> 01:13:51,760
dream because I think that would help

1480
01:13:48,719 --> 01:13:54,800
massively for our ability to to think to

1481
01:13:51,760 --> 01:13:57,040
reflect to question um and especially in

1482
01:13:54,800 --> 01:14:02,400
a world in which you know an answer is

1483
01:13:57,040 --> 01:14:04,159
just a little chat conversation away um

1484
01:14:02,400 --> 01:14:06,560
yeah

1485
01:14:04,159 --> 01:14:09,520
so I think that's it's a good good spot

1486
01:14:06,560 --> 01:14:12,000
to end. um wondering if you have any

1487
01:14:09,520 --> 01:14:14,400
kind of practical advice for anybody

1488
01:14:12,000 --> 01:14:15,679
listening that that perhaps this

1489
01:14:14,400 --> 01:14:17,760
conversation has piqu their interest in

1490
01:14:15,679 --> 01:14:21,840
the zero caston system where they might

1491
01:14:17,760 --> 01:14:24,080
go uh to kind of learn more about this.

1492
01:14:21,840 --> 01:14:26,000
>> Well, what I offer you can find on

1493
01:14:24,080 --> 01:14:28,560
techsmartnotes.com.

1494
01:14:26,000 --> 01:14:32,239
Um but there is a lot out there

1495
01:14:28,560 --> 01:14:35,199
especially the Obsidian community is so

1496
01:14:32,239 --> 01:14:38,320
lively and helpful and friendly and

1497
01:14:35,199 --> 01:14:43,360
supportive. I think you'll find a lot of

1498
01:14:38,320 --> 01:14:47,120
information and um support there. Um

1499
01:14:43,360 --> 01:14:52,320
and I wouldn't underestimate

1500
01:14:47,120 --> 01:14:54,800
the power of the metaphor of external

1501
01:14:52,320 --> 01:14:56,880
thinking. Just thinking differently

1502
01:14:54,800 --> 01:15:00,320
about thinking makes a huge difference

1503
01:14:56,880 --> 01:15:05,679
in my opinion. um taking more seriously

1504
01:15:00,320 --> 01:15:11,280
notetaking and what it can do to support

1505
01:15:05,679 --> 01:15:15,199
your uh ideas and thought development

1506
01:15:11,280 --> 01:15:18,560
and not just thinking about thinking as

1507
01:15:15,199 --> 01:15:21,840
something that goes on in your brain

1508
01:15:18,560 --> 01:15:24,719
just as a metaphor. I think it's it's

1509
01:15:21,840 --> 01:15:28,840
can be extremely useful. That that

1510
01:15:24,719 --> 01:15:28,840
that's my two cents.

1511
01:15:29,280 --> 01:15:34,480
>> Well, uh thank you so much Dr. Sank Arns

1512
01:15:32,400 --> 01:15:37,520

1513
